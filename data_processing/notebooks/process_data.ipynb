The costs for building each tower are as follows:\\n     - Tower 0: 411 units\\n     - Tower 1: 294 units\\n     - Tower 2: 376 units\\n     - Tower 3: 447 units\\n     - Tower 4: 414 units\\n     - Tower 5: 498 units\\n     - Tower 6: 437 units\\n     - Tower 7: 272 units\\n     - Tower 8: 381 units\\n     - Tower 9: 323 units\\n     - Tower 10: 356 units\\n     - Tower 11: 200 units\\n     - Tower 12: 297 units\\n     - Tower 13: 428 units\\n     - Tower 14: 427 units\\n     - Tower 15: 484 units\\n     - Tower 16: 494 units\\n     - Tower 17: 436 units\\n     - Tower 18: 218 units\\n     - Tower 19: 428 units\\n     - Tower 20: 399 units\\n     - Tower 21: 484 units\\n     - Tower 22: 367 units\\n     - Tower 23: 204 units\\n     - Tower 24: 289 units\\n     - Tower 25: 283 units\\n\\n3. **Binary Decisions**:\\n   - Each tower can either be built (1) or not built (0).\\n   - Each area can either be covered (1) or not covered (0).\\n\\n#### Summary:\\nYour task is to select which towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total population covered is maximized while staying within the budget. The coverage of each area depends on the specific combination of towers built, and the total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed 2,894 units.\\n\\n# Response:<|im_end|>\\n',\n",
       " 'en_math_model_coptpy_code': 'assistant\\n<thinking>\\nLet\\'s break down the problem step by step.\\n\\nWe have:\\n- 26 potential cell tower locations (towers 0 to 25)\\n- 35 areas that need to be covered (areas 0 to 34)\\n\\nDecision variables:\\n1. For each tower i (i = 0 to 25), let x_i be a binary variable: 1 if we build the tower, 0 otherwise.\\n2. For each area j (j = 0 to 34), let y_j be a binary variable: 1 if the area is covered, 0 otherwise.\\n\\nObjective:\\nMaximize total population covered = sum over areas j of (population of area j) * y_j\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. Budget constraint: sum over towers i of (cost of tower i) * x_i ≤ 2894\\n2. Coverage constraints: For each area j, y_j = 1 only if at least one of the towers assigned to it is built.\\n   - This means: y_j ≤ x_i for each tower i that covers area j (i.e., if tower i is built, then area j can be covered).\\n   - However, we need to know which towers cover which areas. The problem statement gives for each area j, the list of towers that can cover it. For example, area 0 can be covered if any of towers 1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, or 24 are built.\\n   - So for each area j, we need to create constraints that y_j ≤ x_i for each tower i in the coverage list of area j.\\n   - Additionally, we need to ensure that if y_j = 1 (area is covered), then at least one of the towers in its coverage list is built. This is automatically satisfied if we enforce that y_j ≤ x_i for each tower i in the coverage list, because if y_j = 1, then all x_i for towers i in the coverage list must be 1 (since y_j ≤ x_i for each i). But wait, that would force all towers in the coverage list to be built if the area is covered, which is not correct. Actually, the constraint y_j ≤ x_i for each tower i in the coverage list means that if y_j = 1, then each x_i must be at least 1 (since y_j is 1). But that would require all x_i to be 1, which is not what we want. We need the OR condition: y_j = 1 if at least one x_i is 1 among the towers in its coverage list.\\n\\nSo the correct approach is: For each area j, we need that y_j can be 1 only if at least one of the towers in its coverage list is built. This is an OR constraint. We can model this using binary variables and big-M constraints.\\n\\nFor each area j, let C_j be the set of towers that can cover it. Then:\\ny_j ≤ x_i for all i ∈ C_j\\nAnd we also need that if y_j = 1, then at least one x_i = 1 for i ∈ C_j. This is automatically satisfied because if y_j = 1, then all x_i must be 1 (from the constraints), so at least one x_i is 1.\\n\\nWait, actually if we have y_j ≤ x_i for each i ∈ C_j, then if y_j = 1, then x_i must be 1 for all i ∈ C_j, which is stronger than necessary. We want y_j = 1 if and only if at least one x_i = 1. So we need that if at least one x_i = 1, then y_j can be 1. That is, y_j ≥ x_i for some i ∈ C_j. But that\\'s not a single constraint.\\n\\nActually, the correct way to model \"y_j = 1 if and only if at least one tower in C_j is built\" is:\\ny_j ≤ x_i for all i ∈ C_j\\ny_j ≥ (x_i - M) for some i ∈ C_j, but that\\'s not helpful.\\n\\nA standard way to model OR constraints is to use binary variables and big-M constraints. Let\\'s introduce a binary variable for each tower in C_j. But we need to enforce that if at least one tower in C_j is built, then y_j can be 1. That is, y_j can be 1 only if at least one x_i = 1 for i ∈ C_j. So we need to force that if y_j = 1, then at least one x_i = 1 for i ∈ C_j. This is the same as saying that y_j ≤ sum_i x_i for i ∈ C_j. But we also need that if at least one x_i = 1, then y_j can be 1. That is, y_j can be 1 if any x_i = 1. So we need y_j ≥ 0 (which it is) and also y_j ≤ sum_i x_i. But that\\'s not sufficient because we need to force that if sum_i x_i ≥ 1, then y_j can be 1. Actually, we need that y_j can be 1 if sum_i x_i ≥ 1. That is, we don\\'t require that y_j = 1 when sum_i x_i ≥ 1, but we allow y_j = 1 if sum_i x_i ≥ 1. So we need that y_j is 0 only if sum_i x_i = 0. That is, y_j ≥ sum_i x_i - M, where M is a large number. But we also need that y_j ≤ sum_i x_i.\\n\\nActually, the standard way is to use a binary variable and create a constraint that forces y_j to be 1 only if at least one tower in C_j is built. Let me think differently.\\n\\nLet me define for each area j, we have a set C_j of towers that can cover it. Then:\\ny_j can be 1 only if at least one tower in C_j is built.\\nAnd we want to maximize population covered, so we want to set y_j = 1 whenever possible.\\n\\nSo the constraints should be:\\nFor each area j:\\ny_j ≤ x_i for all i ∈ C_j  (this ensures that if y_j = 1, then each x_i must be 1, so all towers in C_j must be built)\\nAnd also, we need that if at least one tower in C_j is built, then y_j can be 1. That is, we need to allow y_j to be 1 even if some towers are built. But if we have y_j ≤ x_i for all i ∈ C_j, then if any x_i is built, then y_j can be 1 (since y_j ≤ 1 if x_i = 1). Actually, if we have y_j ≤ x_i for all i ∈ C_j, then if any x_i = 1, then y_j can be 1 (since y_j ≤ 1). But if all x_i = 0, then y_j must be 0. So this constraint forces that if y_j = 1, then all x_i = 1 for i ∈ C_j. But that is stronger than necessary. We want that if at least one x_i = 1, then y_j can be 1, but we don\\'t require that y_j must be 1. So we need to allow y_j to be 1 if at least one x_i = 1. That is, we need to ensure that if sum_i x_i ≥ 1, then y_j can be 1. This is automatically satisfied because if sum_i x_i ≥ 1, then at least one x_i = 1, so y_j ≤ 1 (from the constraint y_j ≤ x_i for that i). So we can set y_j to 1 if we want. But we also want to force that if y_j = 1, then all x_i must be 1 for i ∈ C_j. That is, we want that if y_j = 1, then the area is covered by at least one tower, but we also want that if we cover the area, then all towers in its coverage list must be built. That seems odd because if we cover the area, we might only need one tower to be built, but the constraint forces all towers in the coverage list to be built. That would make the model force building all towers in the coverage list for any area that is covered. That is not correct. Actually, the constraint y_j ≤ x_i for all i ∈ C_j means that if y_j = 1, then each x_i must be at least 1. So if we set y_j = 1, then all towers in C_j must be built, which is not what we want. We want that if we cover the area, then at least one tower in C_j is built, but we don\\'t require that all towers are built.\\n\\nSo the correct approach is to model the coverage as: y_j = 1 if and only if at least one tower in C_j is built. That is, y_j is 1 if any tower in C_j is built, and 0 if none are built. So we need that y_j can be 1 if any x_i = 1 for i ∈ C_j, and y_j must be 0 if all x_i = 0 for i ∈ C_j.\\n\\nThis is an OR constraint. We can model this with a binary variable and big-M constraints. Let\\'s introduce for each area j a binary variable y_j and a binary variable z_j (or we can use the existing y_j). Actually, we can use the same y_j as the coverage variable.\\n\\nThe standard way to model \"y_j = 1 if at least one x_i = 1\" is:\\ny_j ≤ sum_i x_i\\ny_j ≥ x_i for at least one i ∈ C_j? No, that\\'s not enough.\\n\\nActually, we need that if at least one x_i = 1, then y_j can be 1. That is, we need to allow y_j to be 1 when any x_i = 1. That is, we need that y_j can be 1 if any x_i = 1. That is, we don\\'t need to force that y_j = 1 when any x_i = 1, but we want to maximize population covered, so we would want to set y_j = 1 when possible.\\n\\nSo the constraints should be:\\nFor each area j:\\ny_j ≤ x_i for all i ∈ C_j\\ny_j ≥ sum_i x_i - M for some large M? That doesn\\'t work.\\n\\nActually, we can model this using a binary variable and big-M constraints. Let me think differently.\\n\\nWe want y_j to be 1 if and only if at least one tower in C_j is built. That is:\\ny_j = 1 when at least one x_i = 1 for i ∈ C_j.\\ny_j = 0 when all x_i = 0 for i ∈ C_j.\\n\\nThis can be modeled with:\\ny_j ≤ x_i for all i ∈ C_j  (ensures that if y_j = 1, then all x_i = 1)\\ny_j ≥ sum_i x_i - M for some large M? That would force y_j to be 1 if sum_i x_i ≥ 1.\\n\\nActually, if we have:\\ny_j ≤ sum_i x_i\\nand\\ny_j ≥ x_i for some i ∈ C_j? That\\'s not enough.\\n\\nWait, let\\'s use a standard technique for OR constraints. For each area j, let C_j be the set of towers that cover it. Then the constraint that y_j = 1 if at least one tower in C_j is built can be written as:\\ny_j ≤ x_i for all i ∈ C_j  (this ensures that if y_j = 1, then all x_i = 1, which is stronger than needed)\\nand\\ny_j ≥ 0 (which it is)\\nand\\nWe want to ensure that if at least one x_i = 1, then y_j can be 1. That is, we don\\'t need to force y_j to be 1, but we want to maximize population covered, so we would set y_j = 1 if any x_i = 1. But the constraint y_j ≤ x_i for all i ∈ C_j forces that if y_j = 1, then all x_i = 1. So if we set y_j = 1, then all towers in C_j must be built. That is not what we want. We want that if we build any tower in C_j, then we can cover the area, but we don\\'t need to build all towers.\\n\\nSo the constraint y_j ≤ x_i for all i ∈ C_j is too strong. We need to model that y_j = 1 if at least one tower in C_j is built. That is, we need:\\ny_j = 1 only if at least one x_i = 1 for i ∈ C_j.\\nAnd we want to allow y_j = 1 if any x_i = 1.\\n\\nActually, the correct approach is to use a binary variable y_j and create a constraint that forces that if y_j = 1, then at least one tower in C_j is built. That is, y_j = 1 implies that sum_i x_i ≥ 1 for i ∈ C_j. We can model this with:\\ny_j ≤ sum_i x_i\\nand\\ny_j ≥ x_i for at least one i ∈ C_j? No, that\\'s not enough.\\n\\nActually, we need that if y_j = 1, then at least one x_i = 1 for i ∈ C_j. That is, we can model this with:\\ny_j ≤ sum_i x_i\\nand\\ny_j ≥ 0.\\n\\nBut then if y_j = 1, we need to ensure that at least one x_i = 1. That is, we need that if y_j = 1, then sum_i x_i ≥ 1. That is automatically satisfied because if y_j = 1, then sum_i x_i must be at least 1 (since y_j ≤ sum_i x_i and y_j = 1). So we just need to have y_j ≤ sum_i x_i.\\n\\nBut we also need to ensure that if at least one x_i = 1, then y_j can be 1. That is, we need to allow y_j to be 1 even if some towers are built. But if we have y_j ≤ sum_i x_i, then if sum_i x_i ≥ 1, then y_j can be 1 (since y_j ≤ 1). So we can set y_j = 1 if we want. But we also need to ensure that if we cover the area, then at least one tower is built, which is automatically satisfied because if y_j = 1, then sum_i x_i ≥ 1.\\n\\nSo the correct constraints are:\\nFor each area j:\\ny_j ≤ sum_i x_i for i ∈ C_j  (this ensures that if y_j = 1, then at least one x_i = 1)\\ny_j ≥ 0.\\n\\nBut wait, that would allow y_j to be 1 even if some towers are built, but we need to ensure that if y_j = 1, then at least one tower is built, which is enforced by y_j ≤ sum_i x_i.\\n\\nActually, let\\'s think of it as: We want to maximize population covered, so we want to set y_j = 1 whenever possible. But if we set y_j = 1, then we need to have at least one tower in C_j built. So we can model this with:\\ny_j ≤ sum_i x_i for i ∈ C_j\\nand\\ny_j is binary.\\n\\nThat\\'s all. Because if y_j = 1, then sum_i x_i must be at least 1 (from the constraint), so at least one tower is built. And if sum_i x_i ≥ 1, then y_j can be 1 (since y_j ≤ sum_i x_i).\\n\\nBut we also need to ensure that if we don\\'t have any towers in C_j built, then y_j must be 0. That is, if sum_i x_i = 0, then y_j = 0. That is automatically satisfied because if sum_i x_i = 0, then y_j ≤ 0, so y_j = 0.\\n\\nSo the correct constraints are:\\nFor each area j:\\ny_j ≤ sum_i x_i for i ∈ C_j\\ny_j ≥ 0.\\nAnd x_i are binary variables.\\n\\nBut we also need that if we cover the area, then the area is actually covered by a tower. That is, if y_j = 1, then there is at least one tower in C_j built, which is enforced by the constraint.\\n\\nSo the model is:\\nMaximize sum_j (population_j * y_j)\\nSubject to:\\n1. Budget constraint: sum_i cost_i * x_i ≤ 2894\\n2. For each area j: y_j ≤ sum_i x_i for i ∈ C_j\\n3. x_i ∈ {0, 1} for all i\\n4. y_j ∈ {0, 1} for all j\\n\\nNow, I need to know the coverage sets C_j for each area j.

For example:\\n- Area 0 can be covered if any of the towers 1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, or 24 are built.\\n- Area 1 can be covered if any of the towers 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, or 24 are built.\\n- And so on for all 35 areas.\\n\\nI need to extract these coverage sets for each area.

This specific instance considers a simplified scenario with **2 potential base station locations** (referred to as Base Station 1 and Base Station 2) and **2 key geographical areas** that require coverage (referred to as Area 1 and Area 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Optimization Objectives\n",
      "The goal is to minimize a combined cost function, which includes both deployment costs and capacity expansion costs, while ensuring critical coverage and budget requirements are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Minimize the total deployment cost of the 5G network**: This includes the fixed costs for constructing base stations and the variable costs associated with expanding their capacity.\n",
      "    *   The fixed cost of deploying *each* base station is **100 units**.\n",
      "    *   The variable cost of capacity expansion is **10 units per unit of capacity**.\n",
      "    *   A weight coefficient (λ) of **1.0** is applied to the capacity expansion cost component in the objective function.\n",

The company can offer four types of travel activities for customers: sightseeing tours (A), outdoor adventures (B), cultural experiences (C), and food tours (D).

The specific information is as follows:\\n\\n| Type | Cost (unit cost) | Customer Satisfaction (unit satisfaction) |\\n| ---- | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |\\n| A    | 100             | 70                                      |\\n| B    | 200             | 90                                      |\\n| C    | 300             | 120                                     |\\n| D    | 400             | 150                                     |\\n\\nThe company wants to maximize the total customer satisfaction while satisfying the following conditions:\\n- The total cost of the activities does not exceed the company's budget, assuming a budget of 800 unit costs.\\n- In order to ensure the diversity of the travel plan, at least three types of activities need to be included.\\n- The quantity of each type of activity must be provided as an integer, as the activities cannot be divided.\\n\\nThe question is: Given the above conditions, how should the company develop the travel plan to maximize the total customer satisfaction?\",\n",
       " 'completion': '<thinking>\\nThe problem is about selecting quantities of four types of travel activities (A, B, C, D) to maximize total customer satisfaction subject to constraints. Let me analyze step by step:\\n\\n1. **Decision Variables**: We need to decide how many of each activity type to include. Since quantities must be integers, we have integer decision variables: x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D ≥ 0 and integer.\\n\\n2. **Objective**: Maximize total customer satisfaction = 70*x_A + 90*x_B + 120*x_C + 150*x_D.\\n\\n3. **Constraints**:\\n   - Budget constraint: 100*x_A + 200*x_B + 300*x_C + 400*x_D ≤ 800.\\n   - Diversity constraint: At least three types of activities must be included. This means at least three of the four activity types must have a quantity ≥ 1. This can be modeled using binary variables to indicate whether each activity type is selected (i.e., whether x_i ≥ 1). Let y_A, y_B, y_C, y_D be binary variables where y_i = 1 if x_i ≥ 1, else 0. Then we need y_A + y_B + y_C + y_D ≥ 3.\\n   - Linking constraints: To ensure y_i = 1 when x_i ≥ 1, we can use x_i ≤ M*y_i, where M is a large enough upper bound on x_i. Since budget is 800 and minimum cost per unit is 100, maximum possible x_i is floor(800/100)=8. So M=8 is sufficient. Also, we need y_i ≤ x_i, but since x_i is integer and y_i is binary, x_i ≥ y_i ensures that if y_i=1 then x_i≥1.\\n   - Non-negativity and integrality: x_i ≥ 0 and integer, y_i ∈ {0,1}.\\n\\n4. **Model Type**: This is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem.\\n\\n5. **Implementation**: Use coptpy to model and solve.\\n\\nLet me formulate the mathematical model precisely.\\n</thinking>\\n<model>\\nDecision Variables:\\n- x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D: non-negative integers, representing the quantity of each activity type.\\n- y_A, y_B, y_C, y_D: binary variables, where y_i = 1 if activity type i is selected (i.e., x_i ≥ 1), else 0.\\n\\nObjective Function:\\nMaximize Z = 70*x_A + 90*x_B + 120*x_C + 150*x_D\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1.

This means at least three of the four activity types must have a quantity ≥ 1. This can be modeled using binary variables to indicate whether each activity type is selected (i.e., whether x_i ≥ 1). Let y_A, y_B, y_C, y_D be binary variables where y_i = 1 if x_i ≥ 1, else 0. Then we need y_A + y_B + y_C + y_D ≥ 3.\\n   - Linking constraints: To ensure y_i = 1 when x_i ≥ 1, we can use x_i ≤ M*y_i, where M is a large enough upper bound on x_i. Since budget is 800 and minimum cost per unit is 100, maximum possible x_i is floor(800/100)=8. So M=8 is sufficient. Also, we need y_i ≤ x_i, but since x_i is integer and y_i is binary, x_i ≥ y_i ensures that if y_i=1 then x_i≥1.\\n   - Non-negativity and integrality: x_i ≥ 0 and integer, y_i ∈ {0,1}.\\n\\n4. **Model Type**: This is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem.\\n\\n5. **Implementation**: Use coptpy to model and solve.\\n\\nLet me formulate the mathematical model precisely.\\n</thinking>\\n<model>\\nDecision Variables:\\n- x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D: non-negative integers, representing the quantity of each activity type.\\n- y_A, y_B, y_C, y_D: binary variables, where y_i = 1 if activity type i is selected (i.e., x_i ≥ 1), else 0.\\n\\nObjective Function:\\nMaximize Z = 70*x_A + 90*x_B + 120*x_C + 150*x_D\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. Budget constraint: 100*x_A + 200*x_B + 300*x_C + 400*x_D ≤ 800.\\n2. Diversity constraint: y_A + y_B + y_C + y_D ≥ 3.\\n3. Linking constraints for each activity type i ∈ {A, B, C, D}:\\n   - x_i ≤ 8 * y_i   (since maximum possible x_i is 8 given budget)\\n   - x_i ≥ y_i\\n4.

The specific information is as follows:\\n\\n| Type | Cost (unit cost) | Customer Satisfaction (unit satisfaction) |\\n| ---- | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |\\n| A    | 100             | 70                                      |\\n| B    | 200             | 90                                      |\\n| C    | 300             | 120                                     |\\n| D    | 400             | 150                                     |\\n\\nThe company wants to maximize the total customer satisfaction while satisfying the following conditions:\\n- The total cost of the activities does not exceed the company's budget, assuming a budget of 800 unit costs.\\n- In order to ensure the diversity of the travel plan, at least three types of activities need to be included.\\n- The quantity of each type of activity must be provided as an integer, as the activities cannot be divided.\\n\\nThe question is: Given the above conditions, how should the company develop the travel plan to maximize the total customer satisfaction?\",\n",
       " 'completion': '<thinking>\\nThe problem is about selecting quantities of four types of travel activities (A, B, C, D) to maximize total customer satisfaction subject to constraints. Let me analyze step by step:\\n\\n1. **Decision Variables**: We need to decide how many of each activity type to include. Since quantities must be integers, we have integer decision variables: x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D ≥ 0 and integer.\\n\\n2. **Objective**: Maximize total customer satisfaction = 70*x_A + 90*x_B + 120*x_C + 150*x_D.\\n\\n3. **Constraints**:\\n   - Budget constraint: 100*x_A + 200*x_B + 300*x_C + 400*x_D ≤ 800.\\n   - Diversity constraint: At least three types of activities must be included. This means at least three of the four activity types must have a quantity ≥ 1. This can be modeled using binary variables to indicate whether each activity type is selected (i.e., whether x_i ≥ 1). Let y_A, y_B, y_C, y_D be binary variables where y_i = 1 if x_i ≥ 1, else 0. Then we need y_A + y_B + y_C + y_D ≥ 3.\\n   - Linking constraints: To ensure y_i = 1 when x_i ≥ 1, we can use x_i ≤ M*y_i, where M is a large enough upper bound on x_i. Since budget is 800 and minimum cost per unit is 100, maximum possible x_i is floor(800/100)=8. So M=8 is sufficient. Also, we need y_i ≤ x_i, but since x_i is integer and y_i is binary, x_i ≥ y_i ensures that if y_i=1 then x_i≥1.\\n   - Non-negativity and integrality: x_i ≥ 0 and integer, y_i ∈ {0,1}.\\n\\n4. **Model Type**: This is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem.\\n\\n5. **Implementation**: Use coptpy to model and solve.\\n\\nLet me formulate the mathematical model precisely.\\n</thinking>\\n<model>\\nDecision Variables:\\n- x_A, x_B, x_C, x_D: non-negative integers, representing the quantity of each activity type.\\n- y_A, y_B, y_C, y_D: binary variables, where y_i = 1 if activity type i is selected (i.e., x_i ≥ 1), else 0.\\n\\nObjective Function:\\nMaximize Z = 70*x_A + 90*x_B + 120*x_C + 150*x_D\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1.

Linking constraints for each activity type i ∈ {A, B, C, D}:\\n   - x_i ≤ 8 * y_i   (since maximum possible x_i is 8 given budget)\\n   - x_i ≥ y_i\\n4.

The park design includes four types of facilities: children's play area (x1), sports facilities area (x2), picnic area (x3), and nature conservation area (x4). The costs associated with these facilities are 10, 20, 30, and 40 units per unit area, respectively. The company's goal is to minimize the total cost while satisfying some environmental constraints.\\n\\nDue to the noise impact of the children's play area and sports facilities area, the total area of these two areas must not exceed 1000 square meters. Similarly, to protect the environment, the total area of the picnic area and nature conservation area must not exceed 2000 square meters.\\n\\nFurthermore, there are constraints related to the proportional relationships between different facilities:\\n- The area of the picnic area should be at least 500 square meters more than the children's play area.\\n- Similarly, the area of the nature conservation area should be at least 300 square meters more than the sports facilities area.\\n\\nGiven these conditions, and that the area of each facility should be an integer (as fractional areas are impractical), as well as individual upper limits for each facility's area (700 square meters for the children's play area, 800 square meters for the sports facilities area, 900 square meters for the picnic area, and 1000 square meters for the nature conservation area), the problem is: Given the optimal facility allocation, what is the minimum total cost (in cost units)?

In the COPT code, this is used in conjunction with a binary variable, implying that the compressor can either be **active (1)** or **inactive (0)**. The constraint `c[1] <= 1` for a binary `c[1]` is effectively a definitional constraint, allowing it to be active.\\\\n*   **Unit Operating Cost of Compressor (`q`):**\\\\n    *   Operating the compressor at Node 1 incurs a fixed cost of **5 units** if it is active.\\\\n\\\\n### Decision Variables\\\\n\\\\nThe optimization problem seeks to determine the following:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Natural Gas Flow (`f[i, j]`):** The amount of natural gas transported from node `i` to node `j`.

For each warehouse, there is a fixed setup cost that is incurred only if the warehouse is opened, and each has a specific handling capacity.\\\\n*   **Warehouse 1:**\\\\n    *   Setup Cost: $50,000\\\\n    *   Maximum Handling Capacity: 400 units per period\\\\n*   **Warehouse 2:**\\\\n    *   Setup Cost: $40,000\\\\n    *   Maximum Handling Capacity: 350 units per period\\\\n*   **Warehouse 3:**\\\\n    *   Setup Cost: $45,000\\\\n    *   Maximum Handling Capacity: 300 units per period\\\\n\\\\n**Customer Regions and Demands:**\\\\nThe company needs to satisfy the following demands from its four customer regions:\\\\n*   **Region 1:** Demands 200 units per period.\\\\n*   **Region 2:** Demands 250 units per period.\\\\n*   **Region 3:** Demands 150 units per period.\\\\n*   **Region 4:** Demands 200 units per period.\\\\n\\\\n**Transportation Costs (per unit):**\\\\nThese costs represent the variable cost to transport one unit of product between locations.\\\\n\\\\n*   **From Plants to Warehouses:**\\\\n    *   Plant A to Warehouse 1: $2\\\\n    *   Plant A to Warehouse 2: $3\\\\n    *   Plant A to Warehouse 3: $4\\\\n    *   Plant B to Warehouse 1: $3\\\\n    *   Plant B to Warehouse 2: $2\\\\n    *   Plant B to Warehouse 3: $3\\\\n\\\\n*   **From Warehouses to Customer Regions:**\\\\n    *   Warehouse 1 to Region 1: $3\\\\n    *   Warehouse 1 to Region 2: $4\\\\n    *   Warehouse 1 to Region 3: $5\\\\n    *   Warehouse 1 to Region 4: $4\\\\n    *   Warehouse 2 to Region 1: $4\\\\n    *   Warehouse 2 to Region 2: $3\\\\n    *   Warehouse 2 to Region 3: $4\\\\n    *   Warehouse 2 to Region 4: $5\\\\n    *   Warehouse 3 to Region 1: $5\\\\n    *   Warehouse 3 to Region 2: $4\\\\n    *   Warehouse 3 to Region 3: $3\\\\n    *   Warehouse 3 to Region 4: $4\\\\n\\\\n**Key Considerations and Constraints:**\\\\n*   Warehouses serve only as cross-docking or transfer points; they do not hold inventory over time. This means the total quantity of products flowing *into* an opened warehouse must equal the total quantity flowing *out* of it in any given period.\\\\n*   All customer demands across all four regions must be met completely.\\\\n*   The total units shipped from each plant cannot exceed its respective production capacity.\\\\n*   If a warehouse is chosen to be opened, the total flow of products through it (i.e., the sum of all units shipped into it from plants, which must also equal the sum of all units shipped out of it to customers) cannot exceed its specified maximum handling capacity. If a warehouse is *not* opened, no products can flow through it.\\\\n\\\\n**Your Task:**\\\\nAs an operations research analyst for GlobalGo Goods, your task is to determine the optimal distribution network design. Specifically, you need to identify:\\\\n1.  Which of the three potential warehouses should be opened.\\\\n2.  The exact quantity of products to be shipped from each plant to each opened warehouse.\\\\n3.  The exact quantity of products to be shipped from each opened warehouse to each customer region.\\\\n\\\\nThe ultimate objective is to minimize the total overall cost, which includes both the fixed setup costs for any opened warehouses and the variable transportation costs for all products shipped across the entire network, while satisfying all given demands and respecting all capacity limitations.\",\n",

This is calculated based on the revenue and harvest quantity of each crop.\\nThe objective function is:\\nMaximize $1000 \\\\cdot CropRotation_1 + 2100 \\\\cdot CropRotation_2$\\n\\nWhere:\\n*   $CropRotation_1$ is a binary decision variable (0 or 1) indicating if Crop 1 is chosen.\\n*   $CropRotation_2$ is a binary decision variable (0 or 1) indicating if Crop 2 is chosen.\\n\\nProblem Parameters:\\n*   **Total Land Area:** 100 units\\n*   **Maximum Nutrient Balance:** 50 units\\n*   **Minimum Market Demand:** 30 units\\n\\nParameters specific to each crop:\\n| Crop | Nutrient Requirement | Market Demand | Seasonal Indicator | Crop Revenue | Harvest Quantity |\\n| :--- | :------------------- | :------------ | :----------------- | :----------- | :--------------- |\\n| **1**  | 10                   | 40            | 1                  | 200          | 5                |\\n| **2**  | 20                   | 50            | 1                  | 300          | 7                |\\n\\nProblem Constraints\\n1.  **Soil fertility:** Different crops have different nutrient requirements and contributions to the soil, and it is necessary to ensure a reasonable balance of soil nutrients.\\n    The sum of nutrient requirements of chosen crops must be less than or equal to the total land area multiplied by the maximum nutrient balance.\\n    $10 \\\\cdot CropRotation_1 + 20 \\\\cdot CropRotation_2 \\\\leq 100 \\\\cdot 50$\\n    Which simplifies to:\\n    $10 \\\\cdot CropRotation_1 + 20 \\\\cdot CropRotation_2 \\\\leq 5000$\\n\\n2.  **Market demand:** Different agricultural products have different market demands and prices, and it is necessary to adjust the crop rotation ratio according to market conditions.\\n    The sum of market demands of chosen crops must be greater than or equal to the minimum market demand.\\n    $40 \\\\cdot CropRotation_1 + 50 \\\\cdot CropRotation_2 \\\\geq 30$\\n\\n3.  **Seasonal restrictions:** Different crops are suitable for planting in different seasons, and it is necessary to ensure seasonal restrictions.\\n    The sum of seasonal indicators for the chosen crops must equal 1, meaning exactly one crop can be chosen per season.\\n    $1 \\\\cdot CropRotation_1 + 1 \\\\cdot CropRotation_2 = 1$\\n\\nDecision Variables:\\nThe decision variables $CropRotation_1$ and $CropRotation_2$ are binary, meaning they can only take values of 0 or 1.\\n$CropRotation_i \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\}$ for $i \\\\in \\\\{1, 2\\\\}$\",\n",

For this specific scenario, there are **2 potential locations** available for new branches, labeled as Location 1 and Location 2.\\n\\n**Optimization Objective**\\nMaximize the total potential customer coverage and expected profits of new branches.\\nThe profit generated by establishing a branch at Location 1 is **30 units**, and at Location 2 is **40 units**.\\nLet `x_i` be a binary decision variable, where `x_i = 1` if a branch is established at Location `i`, and `x_i = 0` otherwise.\\n\\nThe objective is to:\\n**Maximize: 30 * x_1 + 40 * x_2**\\n\\n**Problem Constraints**\\n\\n1.  **Budget constraint:**\\n    The construction and operation costs of new branches should not exceed the predetermined budget.\\n    The cost of establishing a branch at Location 1 is **50 units**, and at Location 2 is **60 units**.\\n    The total available budget is **100 units**.\\n    Constraint: **50 * x_1 + 60 * x_2 <= 100**\\n\\n2.  **Geographic constraint:**\\n    New branches must be distributed within the area permitted by laws and regulations.\\n    For this problem, **Location 2 is an illegal location** and cannot be selected.\\n    Constraint: **x_2 = 0**\\n\\n3.  **Competition constraint:**\\n    The location selection of new branches should consider avoiding direct competition with existing bank branches and competitors.\\n    There is a competitive relationship between Location 1 and Location 2, meaning that **at most one of these two locations can be chosen**.\\n    Constraint: **x_1 + x_2 <= 1**\\n\\n4.  **Service coverage constraint:**\\n    Ensure that new branches can cover a minimum number of potential customers.\\n    The target minimum service coverage is **50 units**.\\n    The coverage provided by a branch depends on the distance from that location to other potential points, calculated by the function: `max(0, 100 - distance)`.\\n    The distances between locations are given by the following matrix:\\n    *   Distance from Location 1 to Location 1: **10**\\n    *   Distance from Location 1 to Location 2: **20**\\n    *   Distance from Location 2 to Location 1: **15**\\n    *   Distance from Location 2 to Location 2: **25**\\n\\n    The total service coverage is the sum of coverage contributions from each selected branch, considering its \"reach\" to all potential locations.\\n    If Location 1 is selected (`x_1 = 1`), it contributes:\\n    `max(0, 100 - 10) + max(0, 100 - 20) = 90 + 80 = 170` units of coverage.\\n    If Location 2 is selected (`x_2 = 1`), it contributes:\\n    `max(0, 100 - 15) + max(0, 100 - 25) = 85 + 75 = 160` units of coverage.\\n\\n    Constraint: **170 * x_1 + 160 * x_2 >= 50**\\n\\n**Decision Variables:**\\n*   `x_1`, `x_2` are binary variables (either 0 or 1).',\n",

The goal is to maximize the overall effectiveness of these centers by ensuring they are strategically placed to cover the maximum possible area while adhering to resource constraints.\\n\\n#### Key Decisions:\\n1. **Selecting Locations**: You must decide which nodes will host the emergency response centers. Each node can either be selected (1) or not selected (0) for hosting a center.\\n2. **Pairwise Coverage**: For every pair of nodes, you must determine whether both nodes in the pair are selected. This is represented by a binary decision variable that indicates whether both nodes in the pair are active.\\n\\n#### Objective:\\nThe primary objective is to maximize the total coverage effectiveness, which is calculated based on the pairwise distances between the selected nodes. The effectiveness values for each pair are as follows:\\n- Pair (Node 0, Node 1): 15 units\\n- Pair (Node 0, Node 2): 12 units\\n- Pair (Node 0, Node 3): 15 units\\n- Pair (Node 1, Node 0): 12 units\\n- Pair (Node 1, Node 2): 15 units\\n- Pair (Node 1, Node 3): 11 units\\n- Pair (Node 2, Node 0): 11 units\\n- Pair (Node 2, Node 1): 14 units\\n- Pair (Node 2, Node 3): 11 units\\n- Pair (Node 3, Node 0): 14 units\\n- Pair (Node 3, Node 1): 10 units\\n- Pair (Node 3, Node 2): 14 units\\n\\nThe total effectiveness is the sum of the pairwise effectiveness values for all selected pairs.\\n\\n#### Constraints:\\n1. **Resource Limitation**: Due to budget and resource constraints, you can only select **2 out of the 4 nodes** to host emergency response centers. This means the sum of selected nodes must equal 2.\\n2. **Pairwise Activation Rules**:\\n   - For any pair of nodes, the pairwise coverage can only be active if both nodes in the pair are selected. For example, the coverage between Node 0 and Node 1 can only be counted if both Node 0 and Node 1 are selected.\\n   - If either node in a pair is not selected, the pairwise coverage for that pair must be zero.\\n   - If both nodes in a pair are selected, the pairwise coverage must be active (1).\\n\\n#### Numerical Parameters:\\n- The effectiveness values for each pair are explicitly provided in the objective.\\n- The total number of nodes to be selected is fixed at 2.\\n\\n#### Summary:\\nYour task is to select 2 out of the 4 nodes to host emergency response centers such that the total coverage effectiveness, based on the pairwise distances, is maximized. The selection must adhere to the constraints that pairwise coverage is only active when both nodes in the pair are selected, and the total number of selected nodes does not exceed the resource limit of 2.',\n",

The overall goal is to minimize the total operating costs, accommodate all enrolled students, and minimize student commute times between consecutive classes.\\n\\nThe details of the classrooms, including their seating capacities, operating costs per hour, and locations, are as follows:\\n\\n| Classroom | Capacity (seats) | Operating Cost ($/hour) | Location     |\\n|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|--------------|\\n| C1        | 100              | 50                      | North Wing   |\\n| C2        | 150              | 60                      | South Wing   |\\n| C3        | 120              | 55                      | East Wing    |\\n\\nThe student enrollments for each course, the required hours per week, and the preferred location based on majority student residence are as follows:\\n\\n| Course  | Enrollment (students) | Hours per week | Preferred Location |\\n|---------|-----------------------|----------------|--------------------|\\n| Math 101 | 80                  | 3              | North Wing         |\\n| Biol 201 | 60                  | 4              | South Wing         |\\n| Chem 301 | 90                  | 2              | East Wing          |\\n| Phys 401 | 70                  | 5              | North Wing         |\\n| Econ 501 | 100                | 3              | South Wing         |\\n\\nIn addition to minimizing operating costs and ensuring seating capacities are respected, the new model also aims to minimize the total commute time for students when transitioning between consecutive courses, assigning higher costs to greater differences in course and classroom locations.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. Each course must be allocated to a classroom that can accommodate all enrolled students within seating limits.\\n2. The total hours scheduled for each classroom must not exceed 40 hours per week.\\n3.

Binary variables y[0] to y[4] determine whether stations 0 to 4 become transfer points based on the selection of transit lines.\\n\\nThe objective is to minimize the total cost, which includes fixed costs for establishing lines, operational costs based on frequency, and penalties for unmet demand. Decisions include selecting which lines to establish, determining their frequencies, designating transfer stations, and calculating unmet demand for each OD pair. Constraints ensure demand satisfaction, frequency bounds, vehicle resource limits, and transfer station requirements.',\n",

This is formulated as:\\n\\nMaximize: `(l[1] * 0.05 + l[2] * 0.07) - 0.5 * (l[1] * 0.02 + l[2] * 0.03)`\\n\\nWhere:\\n*   `0.05` is the expected return rate for Loan Type 1.\\n*   `0.07` is the expected return rate for Loan Type 2.\\n*   `0.02` is the risk weight for Loan Type 1.\\n*   `0.03` is the risk weight for Loan Type 2.\\n*   `0.5` is the risk adjustment weight coefficient, which penalizes the total risk in the objective function.\\n\\nThis objective function can be simplified to:\\nMaximize: `0.04 * l[1] + 0.055 * l[2]`\\n\\n**Problem Constraints**\\nThe optimization must satisfy the following constraints:\\n\\n1.  **Total Loan Type Allocation Ratio Constraint:** The sum of the proportions of all loan types in the portfolio must equal 1, ensuring the entire portfolio is allocated.\\n    `l[1] + l[2] = 1`\\n\\n2.  **Minimum Allocation Ratio Requirements:** Each loan type must meet a minimum allocation proportion to align with strategic objectives for portfolio diversity and customer needs.\\n    *   For Loan Type 1: `l[1] >= 0.1`\\n    *   For Loan Type 2: `l[2] >= 0.2`\\n    (Here, `0.1` is the minimum required allocation ratio for Loan Type 1, and `0.2` is the minimum required allocation ratio for Loan Type 2.)\\n\\n3.  **Risk-Bearing Capacity Constraint:** The total risk of the loan portfolio must not exceed the bank\\'s predefined maximum risk tolerance.

Each facility has a fixed cost to open and a limited capacity for serving customers. Your goal is to determine which facilities to open and how much to allocate from each facility to each customer to minimize the total cost, which includes both the fixed costs of opening facilities and the variable costs of serving customers.\\n\\n#### Key Details:\\n1. **Facilities and Costs**:\\n   - There are six facilities, labeled as Facility 0 to Facility 5.\\n   - The fixed cost to open Facility 0 is **155,617 units**, Facility 1 is **162,576 units**, Facility 2 is **159,343 units**, Facility 3 is **156,961 units**, Facility 4 is **149,500 units**, and Facility 5 is **178,248 units**.\\n   - Each facility has a maximum capacity: Facility 0 can handle up to **1,530 units**, Facility 1 up to **1,574 units**, Facility 2 up to **1,665 units**, Facility 3 up to **1,386 units**, Facility 4 up to **1,709 units**, and Facility 5 up to **1,553 units**.\\n\\n2. **Customers and Demand**:\\n   - There are ten customers, labeled as Customer 0 to Customer 9.\\n   - Each customer has a specific demand that must be fully met: Customer 0 requires **667 units**, Customer 1 requires **671 units**, Customer 2 requires **643 units**, Customer 3 requires **657 units**, Customer 4 requires **658 units**, Customer 5 requires **646 units**, Customer 6 requires **556 units**, Customer 7 requires **567 units**, Customer 8 requires **581 units**, and Customer 9 requires **635 units**.\\n\\n3. **Serving Costs**:\\n   - The cost to serve a customer from a facility varies. For example:\\n     - Serving Customer 0 from Facility 0 costs **82 units**, from Facility 1 costs **45 units**, from Facility 2 costs **51 units**, and so on.\\n     - Similarly, serving Customer 1 from Facility 0 costs **62 units**, from Facility 1 costs **84 units**, and so forth.\\n   - These costs are specific to each customer-facility pair and are provided in the data.\\n\\n#### Decisions to Be Made:\\n- **Which facilities to open**: You must decide whether to open each facility (a binary decision: open or not).\\n- **How much to allocate from each facility to each customer**: You must determine the exact amount of resources to send from each open facility to each customer to meet their demand.\\n\\n#### Objective:\\nMinimize the **total cost**, which includes:\\n1. The fixed costs of opening the selected facilities.\\n2. The variable costs of serving customers from the open facilities.\\n\\n#### Constraints:\\n1. **Demand Satisfaction**:\\n   - The total amount allocated to each customer from all facilities must exactly match their demand. For example, Customer 0 must receive exactly **667 units** in total from all facilities combined.\\n\\n2. **Facility Capacity**:\\n   - The total amount allocated from each facility to all customers cannot exceed its capacity. For example, Facility 0 cannot allocate more than **1,530 units** in total across all customers.\\n\\n3. **Logical Constraints**:\\n   - A facility can only serve customers if it is open. For example, if Facility 0 is not opened, no resources can be allocated from it to any customer.\\n\\n4. **Non-Negativity**:\\n   - The amount allocated from a facility to a customer cannot be negative.\\n\\n#### Numerical Parameters:\\n- All fixed costs, serving costs, customer demands, and facility capacities are explicitly provided in the data. For example:\\n  - Fixed costs: Facility 0 = **155,617 units**, Facility 1 = **162,576 units**, etc.\\n  - Serving costs: Customer 0 from Facility 0 = **82 units**, Customer 0 from Facility 1 = **45 units**, etc.\\n  - Demands: Customer 0 = **667 units**, Customer 1 = **671 units**, etc.\\n  - Capacities: Facility 0 = **1,530 units**, Facility 1 = **1,574 units**, etc.\\n\\n#### Summary:\\nYour task is to decide which facilities to open and how to allocate resources from these facilities to customers to meet all demands while minimizing the total cost. The solution must ensure that all customer demands are satisfied, no facility exceeds its capacity, and resources are only allocated from open facilities.',\n",

The scenic area is divided into two conceptual zones, Zone 0 and Zone 1, and the planning considers two distinct time periods, Time Period 0 and Time Period 1 (e.g., normal vs. peak hours). The goal is to meet the physiological needs of tourists, improve tourist satisfaction, and consider the efficiency of space utilization in the scenic area.\\n\\nOptimization Goals\\n-   **Meeting Tourist Needs:** Ensure that the number of toilets is sufficient for each combination of time period and zone (e.g., Time Period 0 in Zone 0, Time Period 1 in Zone 1), specifically requiring at least 1 toilet for each such combination.\\n-   **Improving Space Utilization Efficiency:** Maximize the use of limited space, ensuring that no more than 2 toilets are allocated for any specific combination of time period and zone.\\n-   **Optimizing Operation and Maintenance Costs:** Minimize the total cost associated with planning and maintaining the toilets across all time periods and zones.\\n\\nDecision Variables\\nLet `T_ij` be an integer variable representing the number of toilets to be planned for Time Period `i` in Zone `j`, where `i` can be `0` or `1` (representing Time Period 0 or Time Period 1) and `j` can be `0` or `1` (representing Zone 0 or Zone 1).\\n\\nParameters\\nThe cost `C_ij` for planning and maintaining one toilet for Time Period `i` in Zone `j` is given by the following cost matrix:\\n\\n*   Cost for Time Period 0 in Zone 0 (`C_00`): 5 units\\n*   Cost for Time Period 0 in Zone 1 (`C_01`): 10 units\\n*   Cost for Time Period 1 in Zone 0 (`C_10`): 4 units\\n*   Cost for Time Period 1 in Zone 1 (`C_11`): 8 units\\n\\nObjective Function\\nMinimize the total cost of planning and maintenance, which is the sum of the costs for all toilets across all time periods and zones:\\nMinimize `5 * T_00 + 10 * T_01 + 4 * T_10 + 8 * T_11`\\n\\nProblem Constraints\\n-   **Tourist Flow Constraint:** Each combination of time period and zone requires at least one toilet to meet visitor flow needs.\\n    *   `T_00 >= 1`\\n    *   `T_01 >= 1`\\n    *   `T_10 >= 1`\\n    *   `T_11 >= 1`\\n-   **Space Constraint:** Due to space limitations, each combination of time period and zone can accommodate a maximum of two toilets.\\n    *   `T_00 <= 2`\\n    *   `T_01 <= 2`\\n    *   `T_10 <= 2`\\n    *   `T_11 <= 2`\\n-   **Sanitation Standard Constraint:** (This constraint is mentioned in the original problem description but is not explicitly quantified or implemented with numerical values in the provided COPT code.)',\n",

The primary goal is to make optimal disposal decisions for these two assets to maximize the bank's total net income, considering the expected recovery amounts, the costs associated with disposal, and a weighted cost related to the time taken for disposal.\\n\\nThe decision variables for this problem are binary, indicating whether each asset is disposed of or not:\\n-   `d_1`: A binary variable, which takes a value of 1 if Asset 1 is disposed of, and 0 otherwise.\\n-   `d_2`: A binary variable, which takes a value of 1 if Asset 2 is disposed of, and 0 otherwise.\\n\\nThe problem is defined by the following numerical parameters:\\n-   **For Asset 1**:\\n    -   Time required to dispose of Asset 1 (`T_1`): 5 units.\\n    -   Maximum allowed time for Asset 1's disposal (`T_max_1`): 6 units.\\n    -   Compliance index for Asset 1's disposal (`C_1`): 8.\\n    -   Minimum compliance requirement for Asset 1 (`C_min_1`): 5.\\n    -   Expected recovery amount from Asset 1 (`r_1`): 100 monetary units.\\n    -   Cost of disposing Asset 1 (`c_1`): 10 monetary units.\\n-   **For Asset 2**:\\n    -   Time required to dispose of Asset 2 (`T_2`): 3 units.\\n    -   Maximum allowed time for Asset 2's disposal (`T_max_2`): 4 units.\\n    -   Compliance index for Asset 2's disposal (`C_2`): 7.\\n    -   Minimum compliance requirement for Asset 2 (`C_min_2`): 6.\\n    -   Expected recovery amount from Asset 2 (`r_2`): 150 monetary units.\\n    -   Cost of disposing Asset 2 (`c_2`): 20 monetary units.\\n-   A universal weight coefficient for the time cost (`lambda_`): 1.\\n\\nThe **optimization objective** is to maximize the total net income. This income is calculated for each asset by taking its expected recovery amount, subtracting its disposal cost, and then further subtracting a weighted cost based on the time taken for disposal. This calculation only applies if the asset is actually disposed of (`d_i = 1`).\\nThe objective function is formulated as:\\nMaximize: `(d_1 * (r_1 - c_1) - lambda_ * d_1 * T_1) + (d_2 * (r_2 - c_2) - lambda_ * d_2 * T_2)`\\nSubstituting the numerical values, the objective becomes:\\nMaximize: `(d_1 * (100 - 10) - 1 * d_1 * 5) + (d_2 * (150 - 20) - 1 * d_2 * 3)`\\nWhich simplifies to:\\nMaximize: `85 * d_1 + 127 * d_2`\\n\\nThe **problem constraints** are as follows:\\n1.  **Asset Disposal Time Constraints:** For each asset `i`, if the decision is made to dispose of it (`d_i = 1`), the time required for its disposal must not exceed the maximum allowed time for that asset. If the asset is not disposed of (`d_i = 0`), the constraint is inherently satisfied.\\n    -   For Asset 1: `d_1 * 5 <= 6`\\n    -   For Asset 2: `d_2 * 3 <= 4`\\n\\n2.  **Legal and Regulatory Compliance Constraints:** For each asset `i`, if it is selected for disposal (`d_i = 1`), its compliance index must be greater than or equal to the minimum required compliance level for that asset.\\n    -   For Asset 1: `d_1 * 8 >= 5` (Given that `C_min_1` is 5, a positive value, this constraint implies that `d_1` must be 1, as `0 * 8 >= 5` is false).\\n    -   For Asset 2: `d_2 * 7 >= 6` (Similarly, given `C_min_2` is 6, a positive value, this constraint implies that `d_2` must be 1, as `0 * 7 >= 6` is false).\\n    These constraints, with the given positive minimum compliance requirements, effectively force the disposal of both Asset 1 and Asset 2, provided they meet their respective individual compliance index thresholds.\\n\\nOther constraints mentioned in the original problem description, such as resource and capability limitations, market and liquidity constraints, and risk management constraints, are not explicitly formulated as mathematical constraints within this specific numerical problem instance.\",\n",

Faced with uncertain medical demands and fluctuations in drug supply, optimizing drug inventory levels to meet patient needs while reducing inventory costs is a key issue facing the healthcare industry.\\n\\nThis specific problem focuses on optimizing the inventory of two distinct drug types (Drug 1 and Drug 2) over a two-period planning horizon (Period 0 and Period 1).\\n\\nOptimization Goals\\n1.  **Minimize the total cost of drug inventory**, which includes:\\n    *   **Procurement costs:** The cost of purchasing drugs.\\n    *   **Holding costs:** The cost of storing drugs at the beginning of each period.\\n    *   **Out-of-stock costs:** A penalty incurred if the initial inventory for a given period is less than the demand for that period. This cost formulation implies that a \"bonus\" is received if initial inventory exceeds demand (i.e., a negative out-of-stock cost).\\n2.

In this specific numerical instance, we are dealing with **two flights**, identified as Flight 1 and Flight 2.\\\\n\\\\n**Optimization Objectives**\\\\nThe primary objective is to minimize a weighted sum of passenger delay times and flight cancellation costs. Specifically, the objective function is to:\\\\nMinimize: `(1 * delay time for Flight 1) + (10 * cancellation decision for Flight 1) + (1 * delay time for Flight 2) + (10 * cancellation decision for Flight 2)`.\\\\nThe \"maximize operational reliability of the flight network\" objective is not explicitly quantified or included in the numerical objective function within this model.\\\\n\\\\n**Decision Variables**\\\\nThe model utilizes the following decision variables:\\\\n*   **Flight Cancellation Decision (`c[i]`):** For each flight `i` (Flight 1, Flight 2), `c[i]` is a **binary variable** (0 or 1). `c[i] = 1` if Flight `i` is canceled, and `c[i] = 0` if it operates.\\\\n*   **Flight Delay Time (`d[i]`):** For each flight `i` (Flight 1, Flight 2), `d[i]` is a **continuous, non-negative variable** (greater than or equal to 0). It represents the delay time in some unit (e.g., minutes) for Flight `i`.\\\\n*   **Flight Change Aircraft Decision (`s[i, j]`):** For each flight `i` (Flight 1, Flight 2) and each available aircraft `j` (Aircraft 1, Aircraft 2), `s[i, j]` is a **binary variable** (0 or 1). `s[i, j] = 1` if Flight `i` uses Aircraft `j`, and `s[i, j] = 0` otherwise.\\\\n\\\\n**Problem Parameters**\\\\n*   **Delay Time Weight (`w_d`):** The cost weight for one unit of delay time is **1**.\\\\n*   **Cancel Flight Weight (`w_c`):** The cost weight for canceling a flight is **10**.\\\\n*   **Minimum Connection Time (`M_ij`):** The minimum required connection time between connecting flights is **30** units (e.g., minutes).\\\\n*   **Airport Take-off and Landing Capacity Limits (`C_k`):** There are two distinct airport capacity constraints. For the first capacity constraint (indexed 0), the limit is **1**. For the second capacity constraint (indexed 1), the limit is also **1**.\\\\n\\\\n**Problem Constraints**\\\\nThe adjusted flight plan must adhere to the following constraints:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Availability constraints of aircraft:**\\\\n    *   Aircraft 1 can be assigned to at most one flight: `s[1,1] + s[2,1] <= 1`.\\\\n    *   Aircraft 2 can be assigned to at most one flight: `s[1,2] + s[2,2] <= 1`.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Airport capacity constraints:**\\\\n    *   For the first airport capacity constraint, the total number of active (non-canceled) flights must not exceed **1**: `(1 - c[1]) + (1 - c[2]) <= 1`.\\\\n    *   For the second airport capacity constraint, the total number of active (non-canceled) flights must not exceed **1**: `(1 - c[1]) + (1 - c[2]) <= 1`.\\\\n    (Note: In this specific numerical setup, both airport capacity constraints are identical, implying that out of the two flights, at most one can operate.)\\\\n\\\\n3.  **Passenger connection constraints:**\\\\n    *   It is assumed that Flight 1 and Flight 2 are connecting flights. Therefore, the sum of their delay times must be greater than or equal to the minimum connection time of **30**: `d[1] + d[2] >= 30`.\\\\n\\\\nRegulatory and safety constraints are mentioned in the general problem description but are not explicitly modeled with numerical values or specific equations in the provided COPT code.',\n",

Your goal is to maximize the total profit generated from supplying products to these markets while ensuring that all market demands are met. Here’s the detailed scenario:\\n\\n#### Companies, Markets, and Products\\nThere are **4 companies** (Company 0, Company 1, Company 2, and Company 3) that supply **3 markets** (Market 0, Market 1, and Market 2) with **2 products** (Product 0 and Product 1). Each company has the capability to supply any product to any market, but the costs and revenues vary depending on the company, market, and product combination.\\n\\n#### Profit Calculation\\nThe profit for supplying a product to a market is determined by the difference between the **revenue** earned from selling the product and the **cost** of supplying it. For example:\\n- If Company 0 supplies Product 0 to Market 0, the profit per unit is **8** (revenue minus cost).\\n- If Company 1 supplies Product 1 to Market 2, the profit per unit is **7**.\\n\\nThe total profit is the sum of profits from all company-market-product combinations.\\n\\n#### Market Demands\\nEach market has a specific demand for each product that must be satisfied. The demands are as follows:\\n- **Market 0** requires **19 units** of Product 0 and **20 units** of Product 1.\\n- **Market 1** requires **21 units** of Product 0 and **22 units** of Product 1.\\n- **Market 2** requires **22 units** of Product 0 and **20 units** of Product 1.\\n\\nThese demands must be met exactly by the combined supply from all companies.\\n\\n#### Supply Constraints\\nEach company can supply any quantity of a product to a market, but the supply cannot be negative. This means that all supply quantities must be **greater than or equal to zero**.\\n\\n#### Objective\\nYour task is to determine how much each company should supply of each product to each market to **maximize the total profit** while ensuring that:\\n1. All market demands are satisfied.\\n2. No company supplies a negative quantity of any product.\\n\\n#### Profit Contributions\\nThe profit contributions per unit for each company-market-product combination are as follows:\\n- **Company 0**: \\n  - Market 0: Product 0 = 8, Product 1 = 8\\n  - Market 1: Product 0 = 5, Product 1 = 7\\n  - Market 2: Product 0 = 5, Product 1 = 9\\n- **Company 1**: \\n  - Market 0: Product 0 = 10, Product 1 = 5\\n  - Market 1: Product 0 = 10, Product 1 = 8\\n  - Market 2: Product 0 = 8, Product 1 = 7\\n- **Company 2**: \\n  - Market 0: Product 0 = 6, Product 1 = 8\\n  - Market 1: Product 0 = 3, Product 1 = 10\\n  - Market 2: Product 0 = 7, Product 1 = 3\\n- **Company 3**: \\n  - Market 0: Product 0 = 7, Product 1 = 8\\n  - Market 1: Product 0 = 3, Product 1 = 10\\n  - Market 2: Product 0 = 9, Product 1 = 5\\n\\n#### Summary\\nYour goal is to allocate the supply quantities from each company to each market for each product in a way that maximizes the total profit, ensures all market demands are met, and avoids any negative supply quantities. The challenge lies in balancing the profit contributions across all possible combinations while adhering to the constraints.',\n",

The goal is to minimize the total cost while satisfying certain constraints arising from transportation demands.\\n\\nDue to aircraft availability, the total number of aircraft for routes x1 and x2 cannot exceed 10. Similarly, due to crew availability, the total number of aircraft for routes x3 and x4 cannot exceed 20.\\n\\nAdditionally, there are constraints related to the demand on different routes: the number of aircraft for route x3 should be at least 5 more than route x1. Similarly, the number of aircraft for route x4 should be at least 3 more than route x2.\\n\\nGiven these conditions and the objective of integer aircraft allocation (as fractional aircraft is not practical), as well as the upper limits on the number of aircraft for each route (7 for x1, 8 for x2, 9 for x3, and 10 for x4), the question is: What is the minimum total cost (in million yuan) required for the optimal aircraft allocation?

This model is crucial for the company's market share and future profitability. A key strategic decision needs to be made regarding the primary powertrain technology to emphasize in the initial production run, given the uncertainty in future market trends, fuel prices, and evolving environmental regulations. The company aims to maximize its expected profit from this new model during its critical first year on the market.\\\\n\\\\nAfter extensive market research and internal analysis, Global Motors has identified three potential primary production strategies (actions) for the new SUV, each with different investment and production implications:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Strategy A (A1): Prioritize Mild-Hybrid (MHEV) Technology.** This involves focusing production resources on variants equipped with mild-hybrid systems, offering improved fuel economy over conventional gasoline engines at a relatively lower cost than full hybrids or PHEVs.\\\\n*   **Strategy B (A2): Prioritize Advanced Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Technology.** This strategy focuses on highly optimized gasoline engines, known for their performance and familiarity to a broad customer base, with lower initial manufacturing costs compared to hybrid systems.\\\\n*   **Strategy C (A3): Prioritize Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) Technology.** This involves significant investment in PHEV production, targeting environmentally conscious consumers and regions with strong EV incentives, offering substantial fuel savings and lower emissions.\\\\n\\\\nThe profitability of each strategy is highly dependent on how the market evolves over the next year. Global Motors has identified three potential future market 'states of the world,' along with their estimated probabilities of occurrence:\\\\n\\\\n*   **State S1: Rapid Green Shift (Probability 0.30)**: Characterized by a strong surge in consumer demand for fuel-efficient and low-emission vehicles, driven by high fuel prices and aggressive government incentives for electrified powertrains.\\\\n*   **State S2: Moderate Market Evolution (Probability 0.50)**: Represents a balanced market where both traditional and electrified vehicles find buyers, with moderate fuel prices and evolving but not aggressive environmental policies. Price sensitivity remains a significant factor for consumers.\\\\n*   **State S3: Slow Green Adoption (Probability 0.20)**: In this state, consumer preference largely remains with conventional gasoline vehicles due to lower upfront costs, limited charging infrastructure (for PHEV perception), and stable fuel prices, with minimal new environmental regulations or incentives.\\\\n\\\\nThe estimated profits (in millions of USD) for Global Motors for the first year of the new SUV model's launch, based on the chosen strategy and the realized market state, are provided in the table below:\\\\n\\\\n| Strategy (Primary Focus) | State S1 (Rapid Green Shift) | State S2 (Moderate Market Evolution) | State S3 (Slow Green Adoption) |\\\\n| :----------------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |\\\\n| A1: Mild-Hybrid (MHEV)   | $120 million                 | $80 million                          | $50 million                    |\\\\n| A2: Advanced ICE         | $60 million                  | $100 million                         | $130 million                   |\\\\n| A3: Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV)| $150 million                 | $70 million                          | $30 million                    |\\\\n\\\\nGlobal Motors needs to decide which single primary powertrain production strategy (A1, A2, or A3) to adopt for the new SUV launch to maximize its expected profit for the first year.

The sum of standard and ICU beds cannot exceed 100 due to space limitations within the hospital facility.\\n\\nThe operational cost for a standard care unit is 500 units per month, while the operational cost for an ICU is 3,000 units per month. Both types of care units must be allocated in integer numbers due to the administrative and logistical needs.\\n\\nThe hospital aims to minimize cost while ensuring that no more than 50% of the total monthly accommodated patients are in standard care units. They aim to provide a more intensive and specialized care environment whenever possible.\\n\\nUnder these constraints, what is the minimum total operational cost that satisfies the patient accommodation demand, adheres to space constraints, and ensures an optimal healthcare environment? Additionally, formulate an optimal care unit allocation plan that meets the patient accommodation demand and maintains a balance of healthcare unit types to optimize patient care.',\n",

Let's assume that the resource requirements for these three areas are $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$, respectively. The corresponding costs per unit of resource are ¥50 for personal loans, ¥70 for car loans, and ¥90 for housing loans. The bank's objective is to minimize the cost of resources while satisfying certain constraints.\\n\\nAccording to business requirements, the total resource allocation for personal loans and car loans cannot exceed 500 units. Additionally, due to business scale limitations, the total resource allocation for car loans and housing loans cannot exceed 800 units. Furthermore, to ensure stable operations, the resource allocation for car loans should be at least 100 units more than that for personal loans, and the resource allocation for housing loans should be at least 200 units more than that for car loans.\\n\\nConsidering that each business area has specific resource constraints (personal loans: 0-400, car loans: 0-500, housing loans: 0-600) due to business scale or regulations, and since all values are integers as we cannot have fractional resources, what is the minimum total cost for the bank to allocate resources optimally among the three business areas within the specified ranges? Additionally, the bank also requires that the sum of all allocated resources across the three business areas should not exceed 1000 units, in line with a newer company-wide policy to streamline operations and reduce overall expenses.

Specifically, one unit of cargo can be transported by either one X-type ship, one Y-type ship, or one Z-type ship. However, due to fuel consumption and maintenance requirements, the combined operation of X, Y, and Z ships cannot exceed 220 units.\\n\\nThe cost of operating one X-type ship is 10 units, one Y-type ship is 15 units, and one Z-type ship is 20 units. Due to the indivisibility of ships, the quantities of all three types of ships must be integers.\\n\\nUnder these conditions, what is the minimum total cost while meeting the cargo transportation requirement and adhering to the operating constraints? Please round the answer to the nearest integer.',\n",

They have assessed the potential fees that could be generated by individual advisors or various combinations of advisors if they were to pursue the client independently or in smaller teams, rather than as a full collaborative unit:\\n\\n### Potential Fees Generated by Different Advisory Structures:\\n\\n*   **Individual Efforts:**\\n    *   Advisor I working alone (providing only Investment Strategy): Can secure a fee of $40,000.\\n    *   Advisor T working alone (providing only Tax Optimization): Can secure a fee of $30,000.\\n    *   Advisor E working alone (providing only Estate Planning): Can secure a fee of $25,000.\\n\\n*   **Two-Advisor Teams (Collaborative Efforts):**\\n    *   Team {I, T} (Investment & Tax): By combining their expertise, they can generate a combined fee of $90,000.\\n    *   Team {I, E} (Investment & Estate): Through their joint efforts, they can generate a combined fee of $80,000.\\n    *   Team {T, E} (Tax & Estate): Their collaboration can yield a combined fee of $70,000.\\n\\n### Optimization Objective:\\n\\nElite Financial Planners wishes to design a profit allocation plan for the $150,000 total fee generated by the comprehensive team {I, T, E} among Advisor I, Advisor T, and Advisor E. The primary objective is to maximize the sum of the individual profit allocations to ensure the entire available fee is distributed. This allocation plan must, however, satisfy the following stability conditions to prevent any advisor or subgroup from being incentivized to break away and pursue less collaborative arrangements:\\n\\n1.  **Individual Rationality:** Each individual advisor must receive an allocated profit that is at least equal to the fee they could secure by working alone.\\n2.  **Coalitional Rationality:** Any team of two advisors must collectively receive an allocated profit that is at least equal to the fee they could secure by working together without the third advisor.\\n\\nYour task is to determine the specific profit allocation (in dollars) for Advisor I, Advisor T, and Advisor E that meets these criteria.',\n",

Your goal is to allocate electricity generation from multiple producers to fulfill several contracts while minimizing the total production cost. Each producer has a limited capacity, and each contract has specific requirements that must be met. There are five energy producers (Producer 0 to Producer 4), each with a maximum generation capacity: Producer 0 can generate up to 2,021 units, Producer 1 up to 2,865 units, Producer 2 up to 2,333 units, Producer 3 up to 2,821 units, and Producer 4 up to 2,876 units. There are seven contracts (Contract 0 to Contract 6), each requiring a minimum amount of electricity: Contract 0 requires 874 units, Contract 1 requires 911 units, Contract 2 requires 1,053 units, Contract 3 requires 882 units, Contract 4 requires 1,106 units, Contract 5 requires 1,087 units, and Contract 6 requires 1,057 units. The cost per unit of electricity generated varies by producer and contract. For example, Producer 0’s costs range from 40 to 49 units per contract, Producer 1’s costs range from 40 to 50 units per contract, Producer 2’s costs range from 40 to 48 units per contract, Producer 3’s costs range from 40 to 48 units per contract, and Producer 4’s costs range from 42 to 48 units per contract.

The studio's primary goal for this film is to maximize its 'Audience Engagement Score,' a proprietary metric on a scale from 0 to 100, which combines factors like critical reviews, social media buzz, and long-term viewership. Through extensive internal research and predictive analytics, the studio has developed a model that estimates this score based on three key controllable factors: Marketing Budget, Production Quality Investment, and the Lead Cast's Star Power Index.\\\\n\\\\nThe studio can adjust these factors within specific financial and operational constraints:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Marketing Budget ($x_1$):** The budget allocated for global marketing and promotion campaigns, measured in millions of USD. This budget can range from a minimum of 5 million USD to a maximum of 20 million USD.\\\\n2.  **Production Quality Investment ($x_2$):** The total investment in aspects directly related to the film's visual and narrative quality, such as cinematography, special effects, historical accuracy in sets and costumes, and post-production. This is also measured in millions of USD and can range from 10 million USD to 30 million USD.\\\\n3.  **Lead Cast's Star Power Index ($x_3$):** A composite index reflecting the market appeal and acting prowess of the chosen lead actors, scaled from 1 to 100. The studio's casting department can influence this index, aiming for a value between 60 (established but not A-list actors) and 95 (top-tier, highly acclaimed stars).\\\\n\\\\nThe studio's predictive model for the Audience Engagement Score (Z) incorporates a baseline score, linear contributions from each factor, diminishing returns for higher investments in each factor, and synergistic effects between different factor pairs. Specifically:\\\\n\\\\n-   There is a base engagement score of 40 points, before considering the influence of the three controllable factors.\\\\n-   For every million USD increase in the Marketing Budget, the score increases by 2.5 points. However, this positive effect is quadratically offset by a reduction of 0.05 points for every (million USD)^2 of the Marketing Budget.\\\\n-   For every million USD increase in the Production Quality Investment, the score increases by 1.8 points. This gain is quadratically offset by a reduction of 0.03 points for every (million USD)^2 of the Production Quality Investment.\\\\n-   For every unit increase in the Lead Cast's Star Power Index, the score increases by 0.3 points. This effect is quadratically offset by a reduction of 0.002 points for every (unit)^2 of the Star Power Index.\\\\n-   Interaction effects also play a significant role:\\\\n    -   An additional 0.01 points is gained for every unit product of the Marketing Budget (in millions of USD) and the Production Quality Investment (in millions of USD).\\\\n    -   An additional 0.005 points is gained for every unit product of the Marketing Budget (in millions of USD) and the Lead Cast's Star Power Index.\\\\n    -   An additional 0.003 points is gained for every unit product of the Production Quality Investment (in millions of USD) and the Lead Cast's Star Power Index.\\\\n\\\\nYour task is to determine the optimal levels for the Marketing Budget, Production Quality Investment, and Lead Cast's Star Power Index that will maximize the film's Audience Engagement Score.

Each product has specific monthly demands: Product 0 requires 63 units in the first month, 58 in the second, 77 in the third, and 73 in the fourth; Product 1 requires 76 units in the first month, 73 in the second, 60 in the third, and 78 in the fourth; Product 2 requires 69 units in the first month, 51 in the second, 74 in the third, and 59 in the fourth. Production costs vary by product and month: for example, producing Product 0 in the first month costs 40 units, while producing Product 2 in the fourth month costs 44 units. Setup costs are incurred when production is initiated for a product in a given month: for instance, setting up Product 0 in the first month costs 1211 units, while setting up Product 2 in the third month costs 1097 units. Holding costs are incurred for storing inventory at the end of each month: for example, holding one unit of Product 0 at the end of the first month costs 5 units, while holding one unit of Product 2 at the end of the fourth month costs 5 units. Each month has a limited production capacity: the total production of all products must not exceed 822 resource units in the first month, 814 in the second, 843 in the third, and 803 in the fourth. Production in any month must satisfy the demand for that month, and any excess production is carried over as inventory to the next month. Inventory at the end of the planning horizon must be zero for all products. Production of a product in a given month can only occur if the setup for that product in that month is activated, and the production quantity cannot exceed the specified upper bound: for example, production of Product 0 in the first month cannot exceed 271 units if the setup is activated. The objective is to determine the optimal production quantities, setup decisions, and inventory levels for each product in each month to minimize the total cost, ensuring all demand is met, production does not exceed capacity, and inventory is managed efficiently.',\n",

Through reasonable sales planning, the flow of visitors to the scenic area can be increased, revenue can be increased, and a better tourist experience can be provided. This problem considers two distinct sales strategies (Strategy 1 and Strategy 2) and two different seasons or time periods (Season 1 and Season 2). The decision variables, denoted as `x_ij`, represent the number of tickets sold using sales strategy `i` in season `j`, and these must be non-negative integer values.\\n\\nOptimization Goals\\nThe primary objective is to maximize the net ticket sales revenue, which is calculated as the total revenue from ticket sales minus a weighted portion of the sales strategy costs. A weighting factor of `0.5` is applied to the sales strategy costs to reflect their impact on the overall objective.\\n\\nThe revenue generated and cost incurred per ticket sold vary based on the sales strategy and season as follows:\\n*   **Ticket sales revenue per ticket (R_ij):**\\n    *   Strategy 1 (i=0), Season 1 (j=0): 10 units\\n    *   Strategy 1 (i=0), Season 2 (j=1): 12 units\\n    *   Strategy 2 (i=1), Season 1 (j=0): 8 units\\n    *   Strategy 2 (i=1), Season 2 (j=1): 15 units\\n*   **Sales strategy cost per ticket (C_ij):**\\n    *   Strategy 1 (i=0), Season 1 (j=0): 2 units\\n    *   Strategy 1 (i=0), Season 2 (j=1): 3 units\\n    *   Strategy 2 (i=1), Season 1 (j=0): 1 unit\\n    *   Strategy 2 (i=1), Season 2 (j=1): 2 units\\n\\nThe objective is to maximize the following expression:\\n`(10 * x_00 - 0.5 * 2 * x_00) + (12 * x_01 - 0.5 * 3 * x_01) + (8 * x_10 - 0.5 * 1 * x_10) + (15 * x_11 - 0.5 * 2 * x_11)`\\nWhich simplifies to:\\n`9 * x_00 + 10.5 * x_01 + 7.5 * x_10 + 14 * x_11`\\n\\nProblem Constraints\\nThe sales planning must adhere to the following constraints to ensure operational feasibility and meet visitor flow targets:\\n\\n*   **Venue capacity constraint:** The total number of tickets sold across all strategies within any given season must not exceed the scenic spot's maximum capacity limit of 200 visitors.\\n    *   For Season 1 (j=0): `x_00 + x_10 <= 200`\\n    *   For Season 2 (j=1): `x_01 + x_11 <= 200`\\n\\n*   **Visitor flow requirements (Seasonal Constraint):** Each sales strategy is required to generate a minimum expected total visitor flow of 50 visitors across both seasons. The expected visitor flow generated per ticket sold varies by strategy and season:\\n    *   **Expected visitor flow per ticket (P_ij):**\\n        *   Strategy 1 (i=0), Season 1 (j=0): 100 visitors\\n        *   Strategy 1 (i=0), Season 2 (j=1): 120 visitors\\n        *   Strategy 2 (i=1), Season 1 (j=0): 80 visitors\\n        *   Strategy 2 (i=1), Season 2 (j=1): 150 visitors\\n    *   Based on these values, the constraints are:\\n        *   For Strategy 1 (i=0): `100 * x_00 + 120 * x_01 >= 50`\\n        *   For Strategy 2 (i=1): `80 * x_10 + 150 * x_11 >= 50`\\n\\nThe goal is to determine the optimal number of tickets (`x_ij`) to sell for each strategy in each season to maximize the total objective value, while satisfying all capacity and visitor flow requirements. All `x_ij` variables must be non-negative integers.\",\n",

The company has identified two distinct customer segments, referred to as Segment 1 and Segment 2. Personalized premium pricing is intended to improve customer satisfaction while maintaining profitability. This involves analyzing the individual risk characteristics of these two segments to design suitable insurance products and corresponding premiums.\\n\\nOptimization Goals\\nThe primary objective is to maximize total revenue. This total revenue is calculated by summing the income from policies sold to each segment, where the income from a segment is its premium multiplied by its expected sales volume. Specifically, the company seeks to:\\n- Maximize total revenue, which is `100 * p_1 + 150 * p_2`, where `p_1` is the premium for Segment 1 and `p_2` is the premium for Segment 2.\\n- Maximize customer satisfaction by providing personalized, competitive premiums.\\n- Attract high-risk customers to pay higher premiums through differentiated pricing, while enabling low-risk customers to obtain more attractive premiums.\\n\\nProblem Constraints\\nThe premium pricing for Segment 1 (`p_1`) and Segment 2 (`p_2`) must adhere to the following constraints:\\n\\n-   **Individual risk factor constraints:** The individual risk factors for each customer segment are considered.\\n    -   For Segment 1, with a risk factor of `0.2`, the premium `p_1` must be set equal to `0.2 * 100 + 50`. This implies `p_1 = 70`.\\n    -   For Segment 2, with a risk factor of `0.8`, the premium `p_2` must be set equal to `0.8 * 100 + 50`. This implies `p_2 = 130`.\\n\\n-   **Pricing fairness constraints:** The company aims to maintain fairness in pricing, ensuring that customer segments with similar risk levels have similar premium levels.\\n    -   The risk factor for Segment 1 is `0.2`, and for Segment 2 is `0.8`.\\n    -   The threshold for considering risk levels \"similar\" is an absolute difference of `0.1`.\\n    -   The absolute difference between the risk factors of Segment 1 and Segment 2 is `|0.2 - 0.8| = 0.6`.\\n    -   Since `0.6` is not less than or equal to the similarity threshold `0.1`, Segment 1 and Segment 2 are **not** considered to have similar risk levels in this specific numerical instance. Therefore, no additional premium difference constraint (e.g., `|p_1 - p_2| <= 20`) is imposed by the pricing fairness criteria for this problem setup.\\n\\n-   **Legal and regulatory constraints:** All personalized premium pricing strategies must comply with local laws and regulations and consumer protection laws. These are specifically implemented as bounds on the premiums:\\n    -   Each premium must be at least `50`: `p_1 >= 50` and `p_2 >= 50`.\\n    -   Each premium must not exceed `500`: `p_1 <= 500` and `p_2 <= 500`.\\n\\n**Decision Variables:**\\n-   `p_1`: The premium for customer Segment 1.\\n-   `p_2`: The premium for customer Segment 2.\\n\\n**Numerical Objective Function:**\\nMaximize `100 * p_1 + 150 * p_2`\\n\\n**Numerical Constraints:**\\n1.  `p_1 = 70` (Derived from `p_1 = 0.2 * 100 + 50`)\\n2.  `p_2 = 130` (Derived from `p_2 = 0.8 * 100 + 50`)\\n3.  `50 <= p_1 <= 500`\\n4.  `50 <= p_2 <= 500`',\n",

The company needs to decide the appropriate number and proportion of each type of vehicle to fulfill a daily delivery target of at least 20,000 packages while reducing its impact on the environment in terms of CO2 emissions. The CO2 emissions are quantified at 1.8 kg per package delivered by trucks and 0.8 kg per package delivered by electric vans.\\n\\nEach truck has a delivery capacity of about 200 packages per day, whereas an electric van can deliver 120 packages per day. Nevertheless, given budget and operational constraints, the total number of trucks and electric vans in operation cannot exceed 150.\\n\\nOperationally, a truck costs $1500 per day and an electric van $800 per day to operate. As vehicles are indivisible, the number of each vehicle type must be whole numbers.\\n\\nTo promote environmental sustainability, the company mandates that at least 30% of the daily package delivery should be covered by electric vans.\\n\\nThe company seeks to identify an optimal mix of trucks and electric vans that meets the daily delivery requirement, stays within the limit of total vehicles, minimizes operational costs, and significantly reduces CO2 emissions. To achieve these goals, the company incurs a penalty of $12 per kilogram of CO2 emitted which contributes to the total cost of operations.\\n\\nTherefore, the objective is to determine the total cost incorporating operating costs and CO2 emission penalties, that satisfies all operational and environmental constraints while resulting in the least CO2 emissions.

The goal is to minimize the number of containers used while ensuring that all items are packed and that no container exceeds its capacity.\\n\\n#### Scenario Details:\\n- **Items to Pack**: There are four items that need to be packed into containers. Each item has a specific weight:\\n  - Item 0 weighs 33 units.\\n  - Item 1 weighs 27 units.\\n  - Item 2 weighs 25 units.\\n  - Item 3 weighs 26 units.\\n\\n- **Containers**: You have four containers available, each with a maximum capacity of 100 units. Containers can be used or left unused, and the decision to use a container incurs a cost (e.g., rental or operational cost).\\n\\n#### Decisions to Make:\\n1. **Container Usage**: Decide whether to use each container (Container 0, Container 1, Container 2, or Container 3). Using a container is represented by a binary decision (use or do not use).\\n2. **Item Assignment**: Assign each item to exactly one container. Each item must be packed into a single container, and no item can be split across multiple containers.\\n\\n#### Objective:\\nMinimize the total number of containers used. This directly reduces costs associated with container usage, such as rental fees or transportation expenses.\\n\\n#### Constraints:\\n1. **Capacity Constraint**: The total weight of items assigned to any container must not exceed its capacity of 100 units. For example:\\n   - If Container 0 is used, the combined weight of items assigned to it (Item 0, Item 1, Item 2, or Item 3) must be ≤ 100 units.\\n   - This constraint applies to all containers (Container 0, Container 1, Container 2, and Container 3).\\n\\n2. **Assignment Constraint**: Each item must be assigned to exactly one container. For example:\\n   - Item 0 must be assigned to one of the four containers (Container 0, Container 1, Container 2, or Container 3).\\n   - This rule applies to all items (Item 0, Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3).\\n\\n#### Numerical Parameters:\\n- **Item Weights**: \\n  - Item 0: 33 units\\n  - Item 1: 27 units\\n  - Item 2: 25 units\\n  - Item 3: 26 units\\n- **Container Capacity**: 100 units per container\\n- **Number of Containers Available**: 4\\n\\n#### Summary:\\nYour task is to determine the optimal assignment of the four items to the four containers such that:\\n- The total number of containers used is minimized.\\n- No container exceeds its capacity of 100 units.\\n- Each item is assigned to exactly one container.\\n\\nThis problem ensures efficient resource utilization while adhering to operational constraints, ultimately reducing costs and improving logistics efficiency.',\n",

This specific problem focuses on deciding whether to automate for two distinct claims processing strategies, referred to as Strategy 1 and Strategy 2.\\n\\nOptimization Goals\\nThe primary goal is to maximize a composite objective function that balances claims efficiency with a penalty for deviations from an average processing cost.\\n-   **Improve claims efficiency:** This is addressed by incorporating specific efficiency values for each strategy into the objective function.\\n-   **Reduce operational costs:** This is addressed by including a term in the objective function that penalizes the squared difference between each strategy's cost and the overall average cost, weighted by a specific factor.\\n-   **Increase customer satisfaction:** This is an implicit benefit expected from optimizing efficiency and costs.\\n\\nDecision Variables\\n-   For each strategy `i` in {Strategy 1, Strategy 2}, a binary decision variable `A[i]` is defined:\\n    -   `A[i] = 1` if Strategy `i` is selected for automation.\\n    -   `A[i] = 0` if Strategy `i` is not selected for automation.\\n\\nParameters\\n-   **Claim Efficiency (E):**\\n    -   Strategy 1 has a claim efficiency value of **10**.\\n    -   Strategy 2 has a claim efficiency value of **15**.\\n-   **Cost (C):**\\n    -   Strategy 1 has an associated cost of **5**.\\n    -   Strategy 2 has an associated cost of **7**.\\n-   **Average Cost (AvgCost):** The average cost across all strategies is calculated as the sum of individual costs divided by the number of strategies: `(5 + 7) / 2 = 6`.\\n-   **Balance Weight (alpha):** A weight of **0.5** is used to balance the impact of cost variance against efficiency in the objective function.\\n\\nObjective Function\\nMaximize the total objective value, which is a sum across the two strategies:\\n`Maximize: (Efficiency_Strategy1 * A[1] - alpha * (Cost_Strategy1 - AvgCost)^2) + (Efficiency_Strategy2 * A[2] - alpha * (Cost_Strategy2 - AvgCost)^2)`\\n\\nSubstituting the numerical values:\\n`Maximize: (10 * A[1] - 0.5 * (5 - 6)^2) + (15 * A[2] - 0.5 * (7 - 6)^2)`\\n`Maximize: (10 * A[1] - 0.5 * (-1)^2) + (15 * A[2] - 0.5 * (1)^2)`\\n`Maximize: (10 * A[1] - 0.5 * 1) + (15 * A[2] - 0.5 * 1)`\\n`Maximize: 10 * A[1] - 0.5 + 15 * A[2] - 0.5`\\n`Maximize: 10 * A[1] + 15 * A[2] - 1.0`\\n\\nConstraints of the Issue\\n-   **Regulatory and compliance constraints:** It is mandated that Strategy 1 must be automated (`A[1] = 1`) and Strategy 2 must be automated (`A[2] = 1`) to comply with relevant regulations.\\n-   **Information security constraints:** It is also mandated that Strategy 1 must be automated (`A[1] = 1`) and Strategy 2 must be automated (`A[2] = 1`) to ensure the security of the insured's personal and sensitive information. These constraints reinforce the requirement for both strategies to be automated.\",\n",

The primary goal is to maintain the facilities in good condition, extend their operational lifespan, and minimize the total maintenance-related costs. This involves balancing direct maintenance expenditures with the impact of facility downtime.\\n\\nOptimization Goals\\nThe objective is to minimize a combined cost function, which incorporates both the direct financial expenditure for maintenance and a penalty for deviations from a desired average downtime.\\n\\nSpecifically, the objective function to be minimized is:\\n`(10 * x[0, 0] + 0.5) + (15 * x[0, 1]) + (20 * x[1, 0] + 0.5) + (25 * x[1, 1] + 2.0)`\\nThis can be simplified to:\\n`10 * x[0, 0] + 15 * x[0, 1] + 20 * x[1, 0] + 25 * x[1, 1] + 3.0`\\n\\nHere, `x[f, t]` is a binary decision variable, where `f` represents the facility index (0 or 1) and `t` represents the maintenance type/option index (0 or 1). `x[f, t]` takes a value of `1` if maintenance type `t` is performed on facility `f`, and `0` otherwise.\\n\\nThe numerical parameters used in the objective function are:\\n*   **Maintenance work cost (C[f, t]):**\\n    *   Cost for facility 0, maintenance type 0: `C[0, 0] = 10`\\n    *   Cost for facility 0, maintenance type 1: `C[0, 1] = 15`\\n    *   Cost for facility 1, maintenance type 0: `C[1, 0] = 20`\\n    *   Cost for facility 1, maintenance type 1: `C[1, 1] = 25`\\n*   **Maintenance downtime (D[f, t]):**\\n    *   Downtime for facility 0, maintenance type 0: `D[0, 0] = 2`\\n    *   Downtime for facility 0, maintenance type 1: `D[0, 1] = 3`\\n    *   Downtime for facility 1, maintenance type 0: `D[1, 0] = 4`\\n    *   Downtime for facility 1, maintenance type 1: `D[1, 1] = 5`\\n*   **Balance weight (alpha):** `alpha = 0.5`\\n*   **Average desired downtime (AvgDowntime):** `AvgDowntime = 3`\\n\\nThe downtime penalty for each selected maintenance `(f, t)` is calculated as `alpha * (D[f, t] - AvgDowntime)^2`.\\n\\nDecision Variables\\nThe decision variables are `x[f, t]`, where `f` can be 0 or 1, and `t` can be 0 or 1. These are binary variables, meaning `x[f, t] ∈ {0, 1}`.\\n\\nProblem Constraints\\nThe optimization is subject to the following constraints:\\n\\n*   **Maintenance Cycle Constraint:**\\n    *   For facility 0, the sum of `x[0, 0]` and `x[0, 1]` must be greater than or equal to `1`. This ensures that at least one maintenance type is performed on facility 0.\\n    *   For facility 1, the sum of `x[1, 0]` and `x[1, 1]` must be greater than or equal to `1`. This ensures that at least one maintenance type is performed on facility 1.\\n\\n*   **Facility Usage Constraint:**\\n    *   For maintenance type 0, the sum of `x[0, 0]` and `x[1, 0]` must be less than or equal to `1`. This implies that maintenance type 0 can be performed on at most one facility.\\n    *   For maintenance type 1, the sum of `x[0, 1]` and `x[1, 1]` must be less than or equal to `1`. This implies that maintenance type 1 can be performed on at most one facility.\\n\\nAll decision variables `x[f, t]` are binary.',\n",

The goal is to optimally deploy police forces and vehicles to two distinct key areas (Area 0 and Area 1) using two available police resources (Resource 0 and Resource 1). The allocation decisions are binary, meaning for each area and resource combination, the resource is either fully allocated (1) or not allocated (0).\\n\\n**Optimization Objective**\\nThe objective is to maximize the overall benefit, which is calculated based on the coverage provided by resources in key areas and the reduction in crime rate. Specifically, the objective function aims to maximize the sum of `(Coverage_ij - CrimeRate_ij)` for each allocation `Allocation_ij`.\\n\\nThe numerical objective function is:\\nMaximize: `0.2 * Allocation[0,0] + 0.3 * Allocation[0,1] + 0.4 * Allocation[1,0] + 0.3 * Allocation[1,1]`\\n\\nWhere `Allocation[i,j]` is a binary decision variable (0 or 1) representing whether Resource `j` is allocated to Area `i`.\\n\\n**Problem Constraints**\\n\\nThe allocation must satisfy the following constraints:\\n\\n1.  **Resource Capacity Constraint:** Ensures that the total allocation of each police resource does not exceed its maximum capacity.\\n    *   For Resource 0: `Allocation[0,0] + Allocation[1,0] <= 10`\\n    *   For Resource 1: `Allocation[0,1] + Allocation[1,1] <= 15`\\n\\n2.  **Resource Allocation Constraint:** Limits the total amount of resources allocated to each area.\\n    *   For Area 0: `Allocation[0,0] + Allocation[0,1] <= 8`\\n    *   For Area 1: `Allocation[1,0] + Allocation[1,1] <= 12`\\n\\n3.  **Crime Rate Constraint:** Controls the crime rate associated with resource allocation, ensuring it does not exceed a set threshold for each resource.\\n    *   For Resource 0: `0.5 * Allocation[0,0] + 0.4 * Allocation[1,0] <= 4`\\n    *   For Resource 1: `0.3 * Allocation[0,1] + 0.2 * Allocation[1,1] <= 3`\\n\\n4.  **Dynamic Adjustment Constraint:** This constraint ensures that the product of the allocation decision and a dynamic factor is non-negative. Given that allocation variables are binary (0 or 1) and dynamic factors are positive, this effectively ensures that allocation decisions are non-negative.\\n    *   For Allocation `Allocation[0,0]`: `1.2 * Allocation[0,0] >= 0`\\n    *   For Allocation `Allocation[0,1]`: `1.1 * Allocation[0,1] >= 0`\\n    *   For Allocation `Allocation[1,0]`: `1.3 * Allocation[1,0] >= 0`\\n    *   For Allocation `Allocation[1,1]`: `1.0 * Allocation[1,1] >= 0`\\n\\n5.  **Minimum Resource Utilization Rate Constraint:** Ensures that each police resource is utilized at least to a minimum specified level across all areas it can be allocated to.\\n    *   For Resource 0: `Allocation[0,0] + Allocation[1,0] >= 1`\\n    *   For Resource 1: `Allocation[0,1] + Allocation[1,1] >= 1`\\n\\n**Decision Variables:**\\nThe decision variables `Allocation[i,j]` are binary, meaning they can only take values of 0 or 1.\\n*   `Allocation[0,0]`: Whether Resource 0 is allocated to Area 0.\\n*   `Allocation[0,1]`: Whether Resource 1 is allocated to Area 0.\\n*   `Allocation[1,0]`: Whether Resource 0 is allocated to Area 1.\\n*   `Allocation[1,1]`: Whether Resource 1 is allocated to Area 1.',\n",

Your goal is to determine the most cost-effective way to transport goods from a central hub (node_0) to a final destination (node_5), while ensuring that all intermediate locations (nodes 1 through 4) maintain a balanced flow of goods. Each route between locations has an associated transportation cost, and your task is to minimize the total cost while adhering to the flow balance requirements at each location.\\n\\n#### Key Details:\\n1. **Locations and Routes**:\\n   - The network consists of six locations: node_0 (central hub), node_1, node_2, node_3, node_4, and node_5 (final destination).\\n   - Goods can be transported directly between any two locations, and each route has a specific cost per unit of goods transported. For example:\\n     - Transporting goods from node_0 to node_1 costs 5 units.\\n     - Transporting goods from node_0 to node_2 costs 3 units.\\n     - Transporting goods from node_1 to node_0 costs 2 units.\\n     - Transporting goods from node_5 to node_4 costs 3 units.\\n   - A full list of transportation costs for all possible routes is provided in the data.\\n\\n2. **Flow Balance Requirements**:\\n   - At the central hub (node_0), the total outgoing goods must exceed the incoming goods by exactly 1 unit. This ensures that the hub is actively supplying goods to the network.\\n   - At the final destination (node_5), the total incoming goods must exceed the outgoing goods by exactly 1 unit. This ensures that the destination receives the required goods.\\n   - For all intermediate locations (nodes 1 through 4), the total incoming goods must equal the total outgoing goods. This ensures that no location accumulates or loses goods unintentionally.\\n\\n3. **Decision Variables**:\\n   - You must decide whether to use each route (arc) between locations. Each route can either be used (1) or not used (0). For example:\\n     - If the route from node_0 to node_1 is used, it incurs a cost of 5 units.\\n     - If the route from node_1 to node_2 is used, it incurs a cost of 12 units.\\n\\n4. **Objective**:\\n   - Minimize the total transportation cost across all routes used in the network.\\n\\n5. **Constraints**:\\n   - The flow balance requirements must be satisfied at every location.\\n   - Each route can only be used once (binary decision).\\n\\n#### Numerical Parameters:\\n- Transportation costs for all routes are as follows:\\n  - node_0 to node_1: 5 units\\n  - node_0 to node_2: 3 units\\n  - node_0 to node_3: 10 units\\n  - node_0 to node_4: 13 units\\n  - node_0 to node_5: 10 units\\n  - node_1 to node_0: 2 units\\n  - node_1 to node_2: 12 units\\n  - node_1 to node_3: 1 unit\\n  - node_1 to node_4: 10 units\\n  - node_1 to node_5: 11 units\\n  - node_2 to node_0: 14 units\\n  - node_2 to node_1: 13 units\\n  - node_2 to node_3: 9 units\\n  - node_2 to node_4: 10 units\\n  - node_2 to node_5: 14 units\\n  - node_3 to node_0: 7 units\\n  - node_3 to node_1: 4 units\\n  - node_3 to node_2: 14 units\\n  - node_3 to node_4: 9 units\\n  - node_3 to node_5: 1 unit\\n  - node_4 to node_0: 9 units\\n  - node_4 to node_1: 5 units\\n  - node_4 to node_2: 13 units\\n  - node_4 to node_3: 1 unit\\n  - node_4 to node_5: 7 units\\n  - node_5 to node_0: 7 units\\n  - node_5 to node_1: 12 units\\n  - node_5 to node_2: 1 unit\\n  - node_5 to node_3: 12 units\\n  - node_5 to node_4: 3 units\\n\\n#### Summary:\\nYour task is to determine the optimal set of routes to transport goods from the central hub (node_0) to the final destination (node_5) while minimizing the total transportation cost. You must ensure that the flow of goods is balanced at all intermediate locations and that the central hub and final destination meet their specific flow requirements. The solution must account for the binary nature of route usage and incorporate all provided transportation costs.',\n",

The company aims to maximize its overall projected profit by optimally allocating its limited marketing resources across three key international markets: Europe (EU), North America (NA), and Southeast Asia (SEA).\\n\\nFor the upcoming quarter, Global E-Comm Solutions has the following total resources available:\\n*   **Total Marketing Budget**: $150,000\\n*   **Total Marketing Specialist Hours**: 2,500 hours\\n\\nThe finance and marketing departments have collaborated to estimate the profit contribution generated per unit of resource allocated to each market, based on historical data and market analysis. These figures represent the expected profit (in USD) for every dollar spent on marketing budget or every hour dedicated by a marketing specialist in a specific market:\\n\\n| Market            | Profit per $1 Marketing Budget (USD) | Profit per 1 Marketing Hour (USD) |\\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\\n| Europe (EU)       | 1.6                                  | 22                                |\\n| North America (NA)| 1.9                                  | 28                                |\\n| Southeast Asia (SEA)| 1.4                                  | 19                                |\\n\\nTo ensure a balanced and effective marketing presence, the company has also established several operational guidelines and constraints:\\n\\n1.  **Minimum Market Presence (Budget)**: To maintain brand awareness and market presence, Global E-Comm Solutions must allocate at least $20,000 to marketing in each individual market (EU, NA, and SEA).\\n2.  **Maximum Market Focus (Budget)**: To avoid over-reliance on a single market and ensure diversification, no single market should receive more than 45% of the total available marketing budget.\\n3.  **Minimum Specialist Engagement**: Each market (EU, NA, and SEA) requires a minimum of 300 dedicated marketing specialist hours to effectively manage campaigns and engage with local customers.\\n4.  **Specialist Hour Distribution Limit**: To prevent overburdening any single team or market, no market can be assigned more than 1,000 marketing specialist hours.\\n\\nYour task is to develop an optimal resource allocation plan that specifies how much marketing budget and how many marketing specialist hours should be dedicated to each of the three markets. The primary objective is to maximize the total projected profit for Global E-Comm Solutions for the upcoming quarter, while strictly adhering to all resource limitations and operational constraints.',\n",

The company can choose from three modes of transportation: electric cars, hybrid trucks, and trains. Each electric car trip generates 50 units of pollution, each hybrid truck trip generates 70 units of pollution, and each train trip generates 90 units of pollution. The company aims to minimize the total pollution generated.\\n\\nThe company can only choose a maximum of two out of the three modes of transportation.\\n\\nDue to limited infrastructure, the number of train trips cannot exceed 8.\\n\\nEach electric car trip can transport 15 units of goods, each hybrid truck trip can transport 25 units of goods, and each train trip can transport 80 units of goods.

Thus, in addition to minimizing the direct pollution per trip, the model should incorporate an indirect pollution factor to simulate varying distances and operation time. This factor is defined quantitatively as an additional 10% increase in total pollution per trip based on the combination and count of vehicle types used. This gives a realistic reflection of varying operational efficiencies and pollutant impacts due to logistics complexity.\\n\\nThe total generated pollution from all trips combined must not exceed 830 units.

This problem considers two distinct entities (e.g., customer segments, product lines, or service regions), labeled as Entity 1 and Entity 2, for which these management strategies are applied.\\n\\nOptimization Goals\\nThe primary objective is to maximize a weighted sum of improvements across satisfaction, complaint reduction, and loyalty, applying strategies to both entities. Specifically, for each entity `i` (where `i` can be 1 or 2):\\n- **Improve Satisfaction (Q_i):** Improve the customer satisfaction score `Q_i` for entity `i`. This score can range from `0` to `100`.\\n- **Reduce Complaint Rate (C_i):** Maintain good customer relationships by reducing the complaint rate `C_i` for entity `i`. This rate is a proportion ranging from `0` to `1`.\\n- **Enhance Loyalty (L_i):** Increase the customer loyalty score `L_i` for entity `i`. This score can range from `0` to `100`.\\n\\nThe overall objective is to **maximize** the total weighted sum:\\n`1.0 * (Q_1 + Q_2) + 1.0 * ((1 - C_1) + (1 - C_2)) + 1.0 * (L_1 + L_2)`\\nThis indicates that improving satisfaction, reducing the complaint rate (by maximizing `1 - C_i`), and enhancing loyalty are given equal importance (a weight of `1.0`) in the optimization.\\n\\nProblem Constraints\\n- **Satisfaction Target:** For each entity `i`, the customer satisfaction score `Q_i` must be at least `70`. Additionally, the satisfaction score `Q_i` must be within the range of `0` to `100`.\\n- **Complaint Rate Control:** For each entity `i`, the complaint rate `C_i` must be at most `0.2` (or 20%). Additionally, the complaint rate `C_i` must be within the range of `0` to `1`.\\n- **Loyalty Target:** For each entity `i`, the customer loyalty score `L_i` must be at least `50`. Additionally, the loyalty score `L_i` must be within the range of `0` to `100`.\\n- **Resource Limitations:** (Implicitly considered through the defined targets and bounds on variables, preventing excessive investment beyond these specified goals).\\n- **Regulatory Compliance:** (This constraint is conceptual and not explicitly quantified in the provided numerical model, but remains a general consideration).\\n\\nDecision Variables:\\n- `Q_i`: A continuous variable representing the satisfaction score for entity `i`, with a lower bound of `0` and an upper bound of `100`.\\n- `C_i`: A continuous variable representing the complaint rate for entity `i`, with a lower bound of `0` and an upper bound of `1`.\\n- `L_i`: A continuous variable representing the loyalty score for entity `i`, with a lower bound of `0` and an upper bound of `100`.',\n",

Each database has a subscription cost, with $x_1$ costing $1000, $x_2$ costing $2000, $x_3$ costing $3000, $x_4$ costing $4000$, and $x_5$ costing $5000$. The library has dual objectives: to minimize the subscription cost and to maximize access to scholarly content, with access scores assigned to each database based on their importance and demand.\\n\\nThe operational constraints include:\\n1. Due to limitations in storage and maintenance of the platform, the total number of subscriptions for databases $x_1$ and $x_2$ combined cannot exceed 2. Similarly, the total number of subscriptions for databases $x_3, x_4$, and $x_5$ combined cannot exceed 3.\\n2. There are demand-related constraints for the databases:\\n   - The number of subscriptions for database $x_2$ should be at least 1 more than for database $x_1$.\\n   - The number of subscriptions for database $x_4$ should be at least 1 more than for database $x_3$.\\n\\nThe access scores for each database are as follows:\\n| Database | Access Score |\\n| -------- | ------------ |\\n| $x_1$    | 20           |\\n| $x_2$    | 30           |\\n| $x_3$    | 40           |\\n| $x_4$    | 50           |\\n| $x_5$    | 60           |\\n\\nTo address conflicting objectives, a weighted cost function will be used combining the negative cost (subscription cost) and positive value (access score), with weights $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$ to balance the priorities between minimizing costs and maximizing access scores. A suggested initial set of weights are $\\\\alpha = 0.7$ and $\\\\beta = 0.3$, but users can adjust these based on differing strategic priorities. Tuning these weights allows evaluation of different strategies to find the optimal database subscription strategy.\\n\\nGiven these constraints and the requirement for integer subscriptions, the question is:\\nWhat is the optimal database subscription strategy for achieving the minimal weighted combination of costs and benefits in terms of subscription costs and access scores under this strategy?',\n",

The profit per unit sold is $130 for Product 0 and $132 for Product 1. The holding cost for each unit of inventory is $10 per period. Determine how many units of each product to manufacture, store, and sell in each period. In the first period, the production of each product must equal the sum of sales and inventory for that period. For subsequent periods, the inventory carried over from the previous period plus the production in the current period must equal the sum of sales and inventory for the current period. The factory has three types of machines: Grinder, Drill, and Borer. Each unit of Product 0 requires 1 hour on the Grinder, 2 hours on the Drill, and 2 hours on the Borer. Each unit of Product 1 requires 2 hours on the Grinder, 1 hour on the Drill, and 2 hours on the Borer. The Grinder has a capacity of 240 hours per period, the Drill has a capacity of 120 hours per period, and the Borer has a capacity of 120 hours per period. In Period 3, the Drill is unavailable due to maintenance, so its capacity is 0 hours. The maximum inventory capacity for each product in any period is 50 units. The maximum number of units that can be sold for Product 0 in each period is 28 in Period 0, 42 in Period 1, 38 in Period 2, and 23 in Period 3. For Product 1, the maximum sales are 45 in Period 0, 33 in Period 1, 35 in Period 2, and 20 in Period 3. At the end of the planning horizon, the inventory for each product must be exactly 10 units. Ensure that production does not exceed machine capacities, inventory stays within limits, sales do not exceed demand, and the target inventory levels are achieved at the end of the planning horizon.

Specifically, one event can be handled by one coordinator working on either Gala Night or Corporate Conference. The maximum total number of coordinators that can be employed is 150, due to budget constraints and staff availability.\\n\\nThe company also measures the success of each event type, with each having potential attendee satisfaction scores per coordinator. The cost of assigning one coordinator to Gala Night is 7 units, with a satisfaction score contribution of 85%, while the cost of assigning one coordinator to Corporate Conference is 5 units, with a satisfaction score contribution of 78%. A budget constraint indicates that the total cost of hiring coordinators for both events cannot exceed 600 units.

Annually, before the fishing season begins, the cooperative must decide on one of three distinct overall fishing effort levels for their fleet. This decision is critical as the actual abundance of the tuna stock for that year is uncertain and significantly impacts profitability. The stock abundance is influenced by various environmental factors and migration patterns that are not fully predictable.\\n\\nBased on scientific reports and historical data, the cooperative's marine biologists and economists have identified three possible states for the tuna stock abundance in the upcoming year, along with their estimated probabilities:\\n\\n1.  **High Abundance:** This state is estimated to occur with a probability of 35%.\\n2.  **Medium Abundance:** This state is estimated to occur with a probability of 45%.\\n3.  **Low Abundance:** This state is estimated to occur with a probability of 20%.\\n\\nTo address this uncertainty, the cooperative has three distinct fishing effort strategies it can implement:\\n\\n1.  **Aggressive Fishing:** This strategy involves deploying a larger number of vessels and fishing gear, aiming for the maximum possible catch. While potentially highly profitable, it carries significant risks if the stock abundance is low, potentially leading to overfishing and long-term penalties.\\n2.  **Moderate Fishing:** This strategy employs a standard fleet size and fishing intensity, representing a balanced approach to catch and sustainability.\\n3.  **Conservative Fishing:** This strategy utilizes a smaller fleet and lower intensity, prioritizing the long-term health of the tuna stock and minimizing environmental impact, even if it means foregoing some potential short-term profits.\\n\\nThe cooperative's financial analysts have projected the net profit (in millions of U.S. Dollars, after accounting for all operational costs, and any sustainability-related bonuses or penalties for stock impact) for each fishing effort strategy under each possible tuna stock abundance state. These projections are as follows:\\n\\n| Fishing Effort Strategy | Net Profit (Millions USD) if High Abundance | Net Profit (Millions USD) if Medium Abundance | Net Profit (Millions USD) if Low Abundance |\\n| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |\\n| Aggressive Fishing      | $15.0                                     | $8.0                                        | $-7.0                                    |\\n| Moderate Fishing        | $12.0                                     | $10.0                                       | $3.0                                     |\\n| Conservative Fishing    | $7.0                                      | $6.0                                        | $5.0                                     |\\n\\n### Optimization Goal:\\nThe fishing cooperative's primary objective is to determine which fishing effort strategy to implement for the upcoming season to maximize its *expected net profit*, considering the probabilistic nature of the tuna stock abundance.\\n\\n### Problem Requirements:\\n1.  Determine the optimal fishing effort strategy that the cooperative should choose for the upcoming season.\\n2.  Calculate the expected net profit for each of the three available fishing effort strategies.\\n3.

Each factory has unique operational costs, production capacities, and constraints. Your goal is to minimize the total cost of running the factories and producing goods while ensuring that monthly demand is met.\\n\\n#### Key Decisions:\\n1. **Run Decision**: For each month and factory, you must decide whether to operate the factory (1) or keep it idle (0). This decision incurs a fixed cost specific to each factory.\\n2. **Production Level**: If a factory is operational in a given month, you must determine how much to produce. Each factory has a minimum and maximum production capacity that must be respected.\\n\\n#### Objective:\\nMinimize the total cost, which includes:\\n- **Fixed Costs**: Costs associated with running each factory in a given month. These costs vary by factory and are as follows:\\n  - Factory 0: \\\\$300 per month\\n  - Factory 1: \\\\$367 per month\\n  - Factory 2: \\\\$341 per month\\n  - Factory 3: \\\\$230 per month\\n- **Variable Costs**: Costs associated with the actual production at each factory.

Each hub is connected to others via delivery routes (arcs), and each route has an associated cost for transporting goods. Your goal is to determine the most cost-effective way to route deliveries from a starting hub (node_0) to a destination hub (node_6), ensuring that all intermediate hubs maintain a balanced flow of goods.\\n\\n#### Key Details:\\n1. **Hubs and Routes**:  \\n   There are seven hubs labeled node_0 to node_6. Each hub is connected to others via specific routes, and each route has a fixed transportation cost. For example:\\n   - The cost to transport goods from node_0 to node_1 is 2 units.\\n   - The cost from node_0 to node_2 is 3 units.\\n   - The cost from node_1 to node_0 is 9 units.\\n   - The cost from node_6 to node_5 is 8 units, and so on.\\n\\n2. **Objective**:  \\n   Minimize the total transportation cost while ensuring that goods flow from node_0 to node_6. The total cost is the sum of the costs of all routes used in the delivery path.\\n\\n3. **Constraints**:  \\n   - **Flow Balance at Each Hub**:  \\n     Each hub must maintain a balance between incoming and outgoing goods. Specifically:\\n     - At node_0 (starting hub), the total outgoing flow must exceed the incoming flow by exactly 1 unit (representing the initial shipment).\\n     - At node_6 (destination hub), the total incoming flow must exceed the outgoing flow by exactly 1 unit (representing the final delivery).\\n     - At all intermediate hubs (node_1 to node_5), the total incoming flow must equal the total outgoing flow (no accumulation or loss of goods).\\n\\n4. **Decision Variables**:  \\n   For each route between two hubs, you must decide whether to use it (1) or not (0). For example:\\n   - If Arcs[node_0, node_1] = 1, the route from node_0 to node_1 is used.\\n   - If Arcs[node_1, node_0] = 0, the reverse route is not used.\\n\\n5. **Costs and Routes**:  \\n   The transportation costs for all possible routes are as follows:\\n   - From node_0: To node_1 (2), node_2 (3), node_3 (6), node_4 (1), node_5 (10), node_6 (12).\\n   - From node_1: To node_0 (9), node_2 (12), node_3 (13), node_4 (9), node_5 (4), node_6 (10).\\n   - From node_2: To node_0 (14), node_1 (12), node_3 (13), node_4 (4), node_5 (10), node_6 (11).\\n   - From node_3: To node_0 (6), node_1 (7), node_2 (14), node_4 (9), node_5 (9), node_6 (1).\\n   - From node_4: To node_0 (15), node_1 (4), node_2 (6), node_3 (9), node_5 (13), node_6 (12).\\n   - From node_5: To node_0 (8), node_1 (2), node_2 (9), node_3 (13), node_4 (13), node_6 (1).\\n   - From node_6: To node_0 (11), node_1 (1), node_2 (12), node_3 (11), node_4 (7), node_5 (8).\\n\\n6. **Problem Statement**:  \\n   Determine the set of routes to use, starting at node_0 and ending at node_6, such that:\\n   - The total transportation cost is minimized.\\n   - The flow of goods is balanced at each hub, with node_0 sending out 1 unit and node_6 receiving 1 unit.\\n   - Each route is either fully used or not used at all (binary decision).\\n\\nYour task is to find the optimal delivery path that meets all these requirements while minimizing the total cost.',\n",

For example:\\n   - If Group 0 is assigned to Session 0, Group 1 to Session 0, and so on, the total attendees in Session 0 must be ≤ 100.\\n   - This applies to all 10 sessions.\\n\\n2. **Assignment Constraints**: Each group must be assigned to exactly one session.

Each market has a specific demand for each product, and your goal is to allocate the supply of products from the companies to the markets in a way that maximizes total profit. The profit is determined by the difference between the revenue generated from selling the products and the costs incurred in supplying them.\\n\\n#### Key Details:\\n1. **Companies**: There are five companies (Company 0 to Company 4) involved in producing and distributing the products.\\n2. **Markets**: There are four markets (Market 0 to Market 3) where the products are sold.\\n3. **Products**: Two types of products (Product 0 and Product 1) are being supplied to the markets.\\n4. **Demand**: Each market has a specific demand for each product:\\n   - Market 0 requires 19 units of Product 0 and 25 units of Product 1.\\n   - Market 1 requires 21 units of Product 0 and 23 units of Product 1.\\n   - Market 2 requires 24 units of Product 0 and 17 units of Product 1.\\n   - Market 3 requires 18 units of Product 0 and 21 units of Product 1.\\n5. **Profit Contribution**: The profit contribution per unit of product supplied varies depending on the company, market, and product. For example:\\n   - Company 0 earns a profit of 3 units for each unit of Product 0 supplied to Market 0, and 9 units for each unit of Product 1 supplied to Market 0.\\n   - Company 1 earns a profit of 5 units for each unit of Product 0 supplied to Market 0, and 3 units for each unit of Product 1 supplied to Market 0.\\n   - Similar profit contributions apply for all combinations of companies, markets, and products.\\n\\n#### Objective:\\nYour task is to determine the optimal quantity of each product that each company should supply to each market to maximize the total profit. The total profit is calculated as the sum of the profit contributions from all combinations of companies, markets, and products.\\n\\n#### Constraints:\\n1. **Demand Satisfaction**: The total quantity of each product supplied by all companies to a specific market must exactly match the demand for that product in that market. For example:\\n   - The combined supply of Product 0 to Market 0 from all companies must equal 19 units.\\n   - The combined supply of Product 1 to Market 0 from all companies must equal 25 units.\\n   - Similar constraints apply for all markets and products.\\n2. **Non-Negativity**: The quantity of each product supplied by each company to each market must be non-negative. In other words, no company can supply a negative quantity of any product to any market.\\n\\n#### Numerical Parameters:\\nThe profit contributions for each company, market, and product combination are as follows:\\n- **Company 0**: \\n  - Market 0: 3 (Product 0), 9 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 1: 9 (Product 0), 3 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 2: 6 (Product 0), 8 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 3: 7 (Product 0), 4 (Product 1)\\n- **Company 1**: \\n  - Market 0: 5 (Product 0), 3 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 1: 9 (Product 0), 10 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 2: 10 (Product 0), 6 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 3: 3 (Product 0), 8 (Product 1)\\n- **Company 2**: \\n  - Market 0: 4 (Product 0), 5 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 1: 9 (Product 0), 10 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 2: 7 (Product 0), 7 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 3: 3 (Product 0), 7 (Product 1)\\n- **Company 3**: \\n  - Market 0: 10 (Product 0), 6 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 1: 5 (Product 0), 4 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 2: 5 (Product 0), 10 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 3: 9 (Product 0), 8 (Product 1)\\n- **Company 4**: \\n  - Market 0: 8 (Product 0), 6 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 1: 9 (Product 0), 8 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 2: 8 (Product 0), 9 (Product 1)\\n  - Market 3: 6 (Product 0), 3 (Product 1)\\n\\n#### Summary:\\nYour goal is to allocate the supply of products from the five companies to the four markets in a way that maximizes total profit while ensuring that all market demands are met exactly and that no negative quantities are supplied.

The goal is to assign the right number of aircraft of each type to each route while minimizing the total operational costs. The problem involves balancing the availability of aircraft, the demand for each route, and the capabilities of each aircraft type to meet that demand.\\n\\n#### Key Components:\\n1. **Aircraft Types and Availability**:\\n   - There are five types of aircraft available: Aircraft 0, Aircraft 1, Aircraft 2, Aircraft 3, and Aircraft 4.\\n   - The maximum number of aircraft that can be assigned from each type is limited:\\n     - Aircraft 0: Up to 13 aircraft.\\n     - Aircraft 1, 2, 3, and 4: Up to 15 aircraft each.\\n\\n2. **Routes and Demand**:\\n   - There are six routes: Route 0, Route 1, Route 2, Route 3, Route 4, and Route 5.\\n   - Each route has a specific demand that must be met:\\n     - Route 0 requires at least 208 units of capacity.\\n     - Route 1 requires at least 209 units.\\n     - Route 2 requires at least 223 units.\\n     - Route 3 requires at least 203 units.\\n     - Route 4 requires at least 210 units.\\n     - Route 5 requires at least 202 units.\\n\\n3. **Aircraft Capabilities**:\\n   - Each aircraft type has a specific capacity contribution when assigned to a route. For example:\\n     - Aircraft 0 contributes 125 units of capacity to Route 0, 130 units to Route 1, 130 units to Route 2, 129 units to Route 3, 126 units to Route 4, and 129 units to Route 5.\\n     - Similar contributions are defined for the other aircraft types across all routes.\\n\\n4. **Operational Costs**:\\n   - Assigning an aircraft to a route incurs a specific cost. For example:\\n     - Assigning Aircraft 0 to Route 0 costs 1901 units, to Route 1 costs 2041 units, and so on.\\n     - Costs vary depending on the aircraft type and route combination.\\n\\n#### Objective:\\nYour task is to determine the optimal number of aircraft of each type to assign to each route such that:\\n- The total operational cost is minimized.\\n- The demand for each route is fully met.\\n- The number of aircraft assigned from each type does not exceed its availability.\\n\\n#### Constraints:\\n1. **Aircraft Availability**:\\n   - The total number of aircraft assigned from each type across all routes must not exceed its availability limit. For example:\\n     - The total number of Aircraft 0 assigned to all routes combined must be 13 or fewer.\\n     - Similarly, Aircraft 1, 2, 3, and 4 must each have 15 or fewer assignments across all routes.\\n\\n2. **Route Demand**:\\n   - The total capacity provided by all aircraft assigned to a route must meet or exceed the demand for that route. For example:\\n     - For Route 0, the combined capacity from Aircraft 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be at least 208 units.\\n     - Similar requirements apply to the other routes.\\n\\n3. **Non-Negativity and Integer Assignments**:\\n   - The number of aircraft assigned to each route must be a non-negative integer. Fractional assignments are not allowed.\\n\\n#### Numerical Parameters:\\n- **Costs**: The costs of assigning each aircraft type to each route are explicitly provided (e.g., 1901 for Aircraft 0 to Route 0, 2041 for Aircraft 0 to Route 1, etc.).\\n- **Capabilities**: The capacity contributions of each aircraft type to each route are specified (e.g., 125 for Aircraft 0 to Route 0, 130 for Aircraft 0 to Route 1, etc.).\\n- **Demands**: The minimum capacity required for each route is given (e.g., 208 for Route 0, 209 for Route 1, etc.).\\n- **Availability**: The maximum number of aircraft that can be assigned from each type is provided (e.g., 13 for Aircraft 0, 15 for Aircraft 1, etc.).\\n\\nBy carefully balancing these factors, you must determine the optimal allocation of aircraft to routes to minimize costs while ensuring all operational requirements are met.',\n",

Before committing to full-scale drilling and infrastructure development, the company needs to decide on the level of investment in two crucial preliminary exploration technologies. These upfront investments, made before the true geological conditions are known, aim to reduce the risks and potential overall costs of the project.\\n\\n**Decision Variables:**\\nGeoPower Inc. must decide on the following investment levels (in millions of USD):\\n*   **3D Seismic Survey (Investment S1):** This technology provides detailed subsurface imaging. The company can invest up to a maximum of 10 million USD in this survey.\\n*   **Deep Well Logging (Investment S2):** This involves gathering data from test wells to understand rock properties. The company can invest up to a maximum of 8 million USD in this logging.\\n\\nBoth investment levels must be non-negative.\\n\\n**Uncertainty and Scenarios:**\\nThe geological conditions of the potential reservoir are uncertain. Based on preliminary assessments, GeoPower Inc. has identified three possible geological scenarios, each with a specific probability:\\n*   **Scenario 1: High Potential Reservoir (HPR)**\\n    *   Probability: 40% (0.40)\\n    *   Description: Excellent geological conditions with high temperature and permeability, leading to highly efficient energy extraction.\\n*   **Scenario 2: Moderate Potential Reservoir (MPR)**\\n    *   Probability: 35% (0.35)\\n    *   Description: Average geological conditions, providing moderate energy output.\\n*   **Scenario 3: Low Potential Reservoir (LPR)**\\n    *   Probability: 25% (0.25)\\n    *   Description: Poor geological conditions with low temperature and/or permeability, making energy extraction less viable or costly.\\n\\n**Total Project Costs:**\\nThe total project cost for GeoPower Inc. includes the initial exploration investments (Investment S1 + Investment S2) plus the subsequent costs for development, drilling, and potential mitigation/abandonment, which depend on the realized geological scenario and are influenced by the initial exploration efforts. The effectiveness of the exploration investments in reducing subsequent costs varies by scenario:\\n\\n*   **If a High Potential Reservoir (HPR) occurs (Scenario 1):**\\n    *   The base subsequent development cost, without the benefit of optimal exploration, is estimated at 50 million USD. However, each million USD invested in 3D Seismic Survey (Investment S1) is expected to reduce this subsequent development cost by 2.5 million USD, and each million USD invested in Deep Well Logging (Investment S2) is expected to reduce it by 1.8 million USD.\\n\\n*   **If a Moderate Potential Reservoir (MPR) occurs (Scenario 2):**\\n    *   The base subsequent development cost is estimated at 35 million USD. Each million USD invested in 3D Seismic Survey (Investment S1) reduces this cost by 1.5 million USD, and each million USD invested in Deep Well Logging (Investment S2) reduces it by 1.2 million USD.\\n\\n*   **If a Low Potential Reservoir (LPR) occurs (Scenario 3):**\\n    *   The base subsequent cost, which includes costs for early abandonment or minimal development, is estimated at 20 million USD. In this scenario, more extensive exploration primarily helps in early identification of the low potential. Each million USD invested in 3D Seismic Survey (Investment S1) reduces the subsequent cost by 0.8 million USD, and each million USD invested in Deep Well Logging (Investment S2) reduces it by 0.5 million USD.\\n\\n**Environmental and Safety Constraints:**\\nGeoPower Inc. must adhere to stringent environmental and safety regulations. A combined Environmental/Safety Impact Score (EIS) is calculated based on the exploration investment levels. This score must not exceed a certain threshold, which varies depending on the actual geological conditions encountered. The contribution of each investment to the EIS also depends on the scenario:\\n\\n*   **If High Potential Reservoir (HPR) occurs (Scenario 1):**\\n    *   Each million USD of Investment S1 contributes 5 units to the EIS.\\n    *   Each million USD of Investment S2 contributes 4 units to the EIS.\\n    *   The maximum allowable EIS for this scenario is 150 units.\\n\\n*   **If Moderate Potential Reservoir (MPR) occurs (Scenario 2):**\\n    *   Each million USD of Investment S1 contributes 4 units to the EIS.\\n    *   Each million USD of Investment S2 contributes 3 units to the EIS.\\n    *   The maximum allowable EIS for this scenario is 120 units.\\n\\n*   **If Low Potential Reservoir (LPR) occurs (Scenario 3):**\\n    *   Each million USD of Investment S1 contributes 3 units to the EIS.\\n    *   Each million USD of Investment S2 contributes 2 units to the EIS.\\n    *   The maximum allowable EIS for this scenario is 100 units.\\n\\n**Optimization Goal:**\\nGeoPower Inc.'s objective is to determine the optimal investment levels for the 3D Seismic Survey and Deep Well Logging that minimize the *expected total project cost* across all possible geological scenarios, while satisfying all budget, environmental, and safety constraints.\\n\\nYour task is to set up this problem to find the optimal investment strategy for GeoPower Inc.\",\n",

This problem involves optimizing the system for **two distinct regions** (indexed 0 and 1), considering the dynamics of fire spread, specific limited resources, and the real-time nature of the warning system.\\n\\nDecision Variables:\\n*   For each region `i` (where `i` can be 0 or 1), a binary variable `x_i` is defined. `x_i = 1` if the intelligent fire alarm system is active in region `i`, and `x_i = 0` otherwise.\\n*   For each pair of regions `(i, j)` (where `i` and `j` can be 0 or 1), a binary variable `y_ij` is defined. `y_ij = 1` if firefighting and rescue resources are allocated from region `i` to region `j`, and `y_ij = 0` otherwise.\\n\\nParameters:\\n*   **Propagation Coefficients (`propagation_coeff[k][i]`):** These coefficients quantify the impact of an active warning system in region `k` on the fire spread characteristics in region `i`.\\n    *   `propagation_coeff[0][0] = 0.5`\\n    *   `propagation_coeff[0][1] = 0.3`\\n    *   `propagation_coeff[1][0] = 0.3`\\n    *   `propagation_coeff[1][1] = 0.6`\\n*   **Minimum Warning Impact Value (`min_warning_value`):** The minimum required cumulative warning impact that must be achieved in any region `j` is `0.2`.\\n*   **Resource Capacities (`resource_capacity[i]`):** The maximum capacity of firefighting and rescue resources available for allocation from each region `i`.\\n    *   `resource_capacity[0] = 1`\\n    *   `resource_capacity[1] = 1`\\n*   **Maximum Warning Response Regions (`max_warning_regions`):** The total number of regions where the intelligent fire alarm system can be simultaneously active is limited to `2`.\\n*   **Potential Fire Loss (`loss[i][j]`):** The base monetary or societal loss caused by a fire incident impacting regions `i` and `j`.\\n    *   `loss[0][0] = 10`\\n    *   `loss[0][1] = 20`\\n    *   `loss[1][0] = 15`\\n    *   `loss[1][1] = 25`\\n*   **Resource Scheduling Efficiency (Cost) (`efficiency[i][j]`):** This parameter represents the cost associated with allocating resources from region `i` to region `j`.\\n    *   `efficiency[0][0] = 5`\\n    *   `efficiency[0][1] = 10`\\n    *   `efficiency[1][0] = 8`\\n    *   `efficiency[1][1] = 12`\\n*   **Warning System Response Time (`response_time[i]`):** The inherent response time of the warning system if activated in region `i`.\\n    *   `response_time[0] = 2`\\n    *   `response_time[1] = 3`\\n*   **Weight Coefficients:**\\n    *   `lambda_ = 1`: Weight coefficient applied to the resource scheduling cost component in the objective function.\\n    *   `mu = 1`: Weight coefficient applied to the warning system response time component in the objective function.\\n\\nOptimization Goals (Numerical Objective Function):\\nThe primary goal is to minimize a combined objective function, which aggregates three key performance indicators:\\n1.  **Minimize Fire Loss:** This component represents the total potential fire loss, reduced by the impact of active warning systems. It is calculated as the sum over all pairs of regions `(i, j)` of `loss[i][j]` multiplied by `(1 - (propagation_coeff[0][i] * x_0 + propagation_coeff[1][i] * x_1))`.\\n2.  **Minimize Resource Scheduling Cost:** This component reflects the cost of allocating firefighting and rescue resources. It is calculated as `lambda_` (which is `1`) multiplied by the sum over all pairs of regions `(i, j)` of `efficiency[i][j]` multiplied by `y_ij`.\\n3.  **Minimize Warning System Response Time:** This component captures the timeliness of the warning system. It is calculated as `mu` (which is `1`) multiplied by the sum over all regions `i` of `response_time[i]` multiplied by `x_i`.\\n\\nSpecifically, the objective function to minimize is:\\n```\\nMinimize:\\n(10 * (1 - (0.5*x_0 + 0.3*x_1)) + 20 * (1 - (0.5*x_0 + 0.3*x_1)) +\\n 15 * (1 - (0.3*x_0 + 0.6*x_1)) + 25 * (1 - (0.3*x_0 + 0.6*x_1)))\\n+ (1 * (5*y_00 + 10*y_01 + 8*y_10 + 12*y_11))\\n+ (1 * (2*x_0 + 3*x_1))\\n```\\n\\nProblem Constraints (Numerical):\\nThe optimization must satisfy the following constraints:\\n1.  **Fire Spread Model / Minimum Warning Impact Constraint:** For each region `j` (0 or 1), the combined warning impact from all active warning systems must be at least `0.2`. This ensures a minimum level of protection.\\n    *   For region `j=0`: `0.5*x_0 + 0.3*x_1 >= 0.2`\\n    *   For region `j=1`: `0.3*x_0 + 0.6*x_1 >= 0.2`\\n2.  **Resource Limitation Constraint:** The total firefighting and rescue resources allocated from any given region `i` cannot exceed its available capacity.\\n    *   For region `i=0`: `y_00 + y_01 <= 1`\\n    *   For region `i=1`: `y_10 + y_11 <= 1`\\n3.  **Warning System Performance Constraint (Maximum Active Regions):** The total number of regions where the intelligent fire alarm system is active (`x_i = 1`) must not exceed `2`.\\n    *   `x_0 + x_1 <= 2`\\n4.  **Resource Allocation Dependency Constraint:** Resources can only be allocated from a region `i` to any other region `j` (`y_ij = 1`) if the intelligent fire alarm system is active in that source region `i` (`x_i = 1`).\\n    *   `y_00 <= x_0`\\n    *   `y_01 <= x_0`\\n    *   `y_10 <= x_1`\\n    *   `y_11 <= x_1`\\n5.  **Variable Type Constraints:** All decision variables `x_i` and `y_ij` must be binary (i.e., they can only take values of 0 or 1).',\n",

To achieve this, they aim to develop an enhanced risk assessment model that can accurately identify patients at low risk of readmission within 30 days, thereby allowing for targeted post-discharge care for higher-risk individuals. The hospital's data analytics team has identified three key predictive factors and, based on historical patient outcomes and extensive data analysis, has pre-processed these into 'low-risk contribution scores' for a sample set of patients.\\n\\n### Predictive Factors:\\n1.  **Factor 1 (Demographic & Lifestyle Score)**: Aggregated score reflecting a patient's age, socioeconomic status, and general lifestyle indicators. A higher score in this factor indicates a lower readmission risk.\\n2.  **Factor 2 (Clinical Comorbidity Score)**: Aggregated score reflecting the number and severity of chronic conditions, previous hospitalizations, and other clinical markers. A higher score indicates a lower readmission risk.\\n3.  **Factor 3 (Treatment & Recovery Score)**: Aggregated score reflecting the patient's immediate response to surgery, length of hospital stay, and early recovery milestones.

Your goal is to maximize the total revenue generated from selling these delivery packages while ensuring that the capacity constraints of your delivery routes are not exceeded and that customer demand for each package is satisfied.\\n\\n#### Key Components:\\n\\n1. **Delivery Packages**: There are 11 different delivery packages available for customers to purchase. Each package has a specific revenue associated with it, ranging from \\\\$650 to \\\\$1,088 per package. The demand for each package is limited, with the maximum number of units that can be sold for each package ranging from 124 to 219 units.\\n\\n2. **Delivery Routes**: The company operates 7 key delivery routes, each with a limited capacity. These capacities range from 209 to 281 units, depending on the route. Each delivery package utilizes one or more of these routes, and the total number of packages sold that use a particular route cannot exceed its capacity.\\n\\n3. **Revenue and Demand**: The revenue generated from selling each package is as follows:\\n   - Package 0: \\\\$931 per unit, with a maximum demand of 151 units.\\n   - Package 1: \\\\$776 per unit, with a maximum demand of 137 units.\\n   - Package 2: \\\\$1,088 per unit, with a maximum demand of 218 units.\\n   - Package 3: \\\\$951 per unit, with a maximum demand of 154 units.\\n   - Package 4: \\\\$675 per unit, with a maximum demand of 124 units.\\n   - Package 5: \\\\$759 per unit, with a maximum demand of 137 units.\\n   - Package 6: \\\\$919 per unit, with a maximum demand of 219 units.\\n   - Package 7: \\\\$672 per unit, with a maximum demand of 181 units.\\n   - Package 8: \\\\$650 per unit, with a maximum demand of 165 units.\\n   - Package 9: \\\\$650 per unit, with a maximum demand of 173 units.\\n   - Package 10: \\\\$654 per unit, with a maximum demand of 135 units.\\n\\n4. **Capacity Constraints**: The total number of packages sold that utilize each route must not exceed the route's capacity. For example:\\n   - Route 0 has a capacity of 220 units and is used by Packages 1, 3, 6, 7, and 10.\\n   - Route 1 has a capacity of 209 units and is used by Packages 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\\n   - Route 2 has a capacity of 253 units and is used by Packages 2, 8, and 9.\\n   - Route 3 has a capacity of 281 units and is used by Packages 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10.\\n   - Route 4 has a capacity of 264 units and is used by Packages 0, 1, 2, and 10.\\n   - Route 5 has a capacity of 250 units and is used by Packages 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.\\n   - Route 6 has a capacity of 264 units and is used by Packages 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8.\\n\\n5. **Objective**: Your objective is to determine the optimal number of units to sell for each delivery package to maximize total revenue, while ensuring that:\\n   - The total number of packages sold does not exceed the demand for each package.\\n   - The total number of packages sold that use each route does not exceed the route's capacity.\\n\\n#### Constraints:\\n- **Demand Limits**: The number of units sold for each package cannot exceed its maximum demand. For example, Package 0 cannot sell more than 151 units, Package 1 cannot sell more than 137 units, and so on.\\n- **Capacity Limits**: The total number of packages sold that use each route must not exceed the route's capacity. For example, the combined sales of Packages 1, 3, 6, 7, and 10 cannot exceed 220 units for Route 0.\\n\\n#### Decision to be Made:\\n- Determine the number of units to sell for each of the 11 delivery packages to maximize total revenue, while respecting both the demand limits for each package and the capacity constraints of the delivery routes.\\n\\nThis problem requires careful balancing of revenue generation against the constraints of package demand and route capacity to ensure the most profitable outcome for the delivery company.\",\n",

The model considers a simplified scenario involving **two medical staff members** (Staff 1 and Staff 2), **two distinct hospital departments** (Department 1 and Department 2), and **two specific work shifts or time periods** (Shift 1 and Shift 2). The objective is to optimize the assignment of these staff members to departments during these shifts to meet service needs, manage costs, and consider staff satisfaction.\\n\\n    Optimization Goals\\n    The mathematical model aims to find a schedule that balances cost efficiency with staff well-being. The objective function is formulated to achieve this balance by minimizing a weighted sum of total labor costs and maximizing staff job satisfaction. Specifically, the model seeks to:\\n\\n    1.  **Minimize total labor costs:** The total labor cost is calculated by summing costs across all staff, departments, and shifts. Each assigned work unit (`x[i,j,t]`) for Staff `i` in Department `j` during Shift `t` incurs a cost `C[i,t]`. Additionally, any overtime work units (`o[i,t]`) for Staff `i` during Shift `t` are also charged at the rate `C[i,t]`. Due to the structure of the summation in the code, the cost associated with overtime `o[i,t]` for Staff `i` during Shift `t` is applied for each possible department `j` (meaning it's effectively counted twice, as there are 2 departments). The weight for total cost (`alpha`) is set to **1**.\\n        *   The specific cost per work unit (`C[i,t]`) values are:\\n            *   For Staff 1: Shift 1 cost is **10 units**; Shift 2 cost is **12 units**.\\n            *   For Staff 2: Shift 1 cost is **8 units**; Shift 2 cost is **10 units**.\\n    2.  **Maximize staff job satisfaction:** This goal is incorporated into the objective function by subtracting a weighted sum of individual staff satisfaction values. The weight for total satisfaction (`beta`) is set to **1**.\\n        *   The specific job satisfaction (`S[i]`) values are:\\n            *   Job satisfaction for Staff 1 is **5 units**.\\n            *   Job satisfaction for Staff 2 is **6 units**.\\n\\n    The overall objective is to **minimize** the following expression:\\n    `1 * (10*(x[1,1,1]+o[1,1]) + 10*(x[1,2,1]+o[1,1]) + 12*(x[1,1,2]+o[1,2]) + 12*(x[1,2,2]+o[1,2]) +`\\n    `8*(x[2,1,1]+o[2,1]) + 8*(x[2,2,1]+o[2,1]) + 10*(x[2,1,2]+o[2,2]) + 10*(x[2,2,2]+o[2,2]))`\\n    `- 1 * (5 + 6)`\\n    where `x[i,j,t]` is a **binary decision variable** (1 if Staff `i` is assigned to Department `j` during Shift `t`, 0 otherwise), and `o[i,t]` is a **continuous variable** representing the number of overtime work units for Staff `i` during Shift `t`.\\n\\n    Problem Constraints\\n    The scheduling must adhere to the following numerical constraints:\\n\\n    -   **Staff availability constraints:** Each medical staff member can be assigned to at most one department during any given shift.\\n        *   For Staff 1 during Shift 1: `x[1,1,1] + x[1,2,1] <= 1`\\n        *   For Staff 1 during Shift 2: `x[1,1,2] + x[1,2,2] <= 1`\\n        *   For Staff 2 during Shift 1: `x[2,1,1] + x[2,2,1] <= 1`\\n        *   For Staff 2 during Shift 2: `x[2,1,2] + x[2,2,2] <= 1`\\n\\n    -   **Service demand constraints:** Each department's staffing needs must be met for each shift. The minimum service demand (in terms of assigned staff/work units) is **1** for all department-shift combinations.\\n        *   For Department 1 during Shift 1: `x[1,1,1] + x[2,1,1] >= 1`\\n        *   For Department 1 during Shift 2: `x[1,1,2] + x[2,1,2] >= 1`\\n        *   For Department 2 during Shift 1: `x[1,2,1] + x[2,2,1] >= 1`\\n        *   For Department 2 during Shift 2: `x[1,2,2] + x[2,2,2] >= 1`\\n\\n    -   **Rest and vacation constraints:** To help prevent job burnout, there is a maximum limit on the total number of work units (shifts) a staff member can be assigned to within any *single department* across all shifts. This limit for both Staff 1 and Staff 2 is **8 work units**.\\n        *   For Staff 1 in Department 1: `x[1,1,1] + x[1,1,2] <= 8`\\n        *   For Staff 1 in Department 2: `x[1,2,1] + x[1,2,2] <= 8`\\n        *   For Staff 2 in Department 1: `x[2,1,1] + x[2,1,2] <= 8`\\n        *   For Staff 2 in Department 2: `x[2,2,1] + x[2,2,2] <= 8`\\n        *(Note: Given that `x` is binary and there are only 2 shifts, the sum `x[i,j,1] + x[i,j,2]` can be at most 2. Therefore, these constraints are not binding for the given numerical values of 8.)*\\n\\n    -   **Skill matching constraints** and **Continuous working time constraints** as described in the original problem statement are **not included** in this specific numerical model implementation.\",\n",

Effectively planning and executing intelligence gathering missions can maximize the acquisition of key information while minimizing resource consumption and risk. This problem aims to optimize the allocation of intelligence gathering missions, considering various resource constraints and operational risks.\\n\\nWe are considering **2 distinct types of intelligence gathering resources** (indexed 0 and 1) and **2 distinct types of intelligence gathering tasks/targets** (indexed 0 and 1).\\n\\n**Decision Variables:**\\nWe define binary decision variables `x[i, j]`, where `i` represents a resource type (0 or 1) and `j` represents a task/target type (0 or 1).\\n*   `x[i, j] = 1` if Resource `i` is assigned to Task/Target `j`.\\n*   `x[i, j] = 0` otherwise.\\n\\n**Optimization Objectives**\\nThe goal is to determine the optimal assignment of resources to tasks to maximize a combined objective function. This objective function balances maximizing intelligence value and minimizing total risk:\\n1.  **Maximize the total value of key intelligence gathered.** Task/Target 0 has an intelligence value of **10**, and Task/Target 1 has an intelligence value of **15**. The total intelligence value is calculated by summing the values of all tasks that have at least one resource assigned to them, where a task\\'s value is accumulated for each resource assigned to it. This component of the objective is weighted by a factor of **1**.\\n2.  **Minimize the total risk of intelligence gathering missions.** Task/Target 0 has an associated risk value of **2**, and Task/Target 1 has an associated risk value of **3**. The total risk is calculated by summing the risk values for each individual resource-task assignment (`x[i,j] * risk[j]`). This component of the objective is weighted by a factor of **1**.\\n3.  **Optimize resource usage, including personnel, equipment, and time.** (This objective is implicitly handled by the resource availability and time window constraints.)\\n\\nThe overall objective is to **Maximize** the expression:\\n`(1 * ( (10 * (x[0,0] + x[1,0])) + (15 * (x[0,1] + x[1,1])) )) - (1 * ( (x[0,0]*2 + x[0,1]*3) + (x[1,0]*2 + x[1,1]*3) ))`\\n\\n**Problem Constraints**\\nThe allocation of resources to tasks is subject to the following constraints:\\n\\n-   **Resource availability constraint:** The number of tasks that each resource can be assigned to is limited.\\n    *   Resource 0 can be assigned to a maximum of **3** tasks.\\n        *   *Formally:* `x[0, 0] + x[0, 1] <= 3`\\n    *   Resource 1 can be assigned to a maximum of **2** tasks.\\n        *   *Formally:* `x[1, 0] + x[1, 1] <= 2`\\n\\n-   **Risk management constraint:** The total execution risk accumulated by tasks assigned to each resource must not exceed a preset safety threshold of **5**.\\n    *   For Resource 0: The sum of risks of tasks assigned to Resource 0 must not exceed **5**.\\n        *   *Formally:* `(x[0, 0] * 2) + (x[0, 1] * 3) <= 5`\\n    *   For Resource 1: The sum of risks of tasks assigned to Resource 1 must not exceed **5**.\\n        *   *Formally:* `(x[1, 0] * 2) + (x[1, 1] * 3) <= 5`\\n\\n-   **Operation time window constraint:** Specific intelligence gathering tasks need to be executed within a specific time window to ensure the timeliness and accuracy of information. In this instance, Resource 0 cannot be assigned to Task/Target 1 due to time window restrictions.\\n    *   *Formally:* `x[0, 1] = 0`\\n\\n-   **Task dependency constraint:** (This constraint is described in the original problem but is **not explicitly modeled** in the provided COPT code.)\\n\\n-   **Target coverage constraint:** (This constraint is described in the original problem as \"Ensure that all key intelligence targets are covered by at least one type of resource,\" but is **not explicitly modeled** in the provided COPT code.

The company is embarking on a strategic inventory planning initiative for the upcoming five months to ensure optimal product availability while minimizing associated costs.\\n\\nAt the beginning of Month 1, LumiGlow Cosmetics has an initial inventory of 50 units of YouthElixir in its warehouse.\\n\\n**Cost Parameters:**\\n*   **Holding Cost**: For every unit of YouthElixir held in inventory at the end of a month, LumiGlow incurs a cost of $2 per unit per month. This cost accounts for storage, insurance, and the capital tied up in stock.\\n*   **Ordering Cost**: The cost to acquire one unit of YouthElixir from the manufacturer is $25. Orders can be placed at the beginning of each month and are immediately available to fulfill that month's demand.\\n*   **Shortage Cost**: If the total available supply (initial inventory plus any new orders) is insufficient to meet the customer demand for YouthElixir in a given month, a shortage occurs. Each unit of demand that cannot be fulfilled within that month incurs a penalty cost of $10. This cost reflects the negative impact of lost sales, potential damage to customer goodwill, and the expenses of expedited future fulfillment or customer compensation. Importantly, physical inventory levels cannot be negative; any demand exceeding supply results in a shortage.\\n\\n**Demand Forecasts:**\\nBased on comprehensive market analysis and sales projections, the forecasted customer demand for YouthElixir for the next five months is as follows:\\n*   Month 1: 120 units\\n*   Month 2: 80 units\\n*   Month 3: 150 units\\n*   Month 4: 90 units\\n*   Month 5: 110 units\\n\\nLumiGlow Cosmetics Inc. aims to establish an optimal ordering strategy for YouthElixir over the five-month planning horizon. Your task is to determine the precise quantity of YouthElixir to order at the beginning of each month (Month 1 through Month 5) that will minimize the total accumulated cost, encompassing all holding costs, ordering costs, and shortage costs. The plan must ensure that customer demand is met as much as possible, and any unmet demand incurs the specified shortage penalty, with physical inventory never falling below zero at the end of any month. You need to provide the optimal order quantities for each month and the resulting ending inventory levels for each month, as well as the overall minimum total cost.\",\n",

The company needs to determine the number of flights for each type of aircraft per day to meet the demand of at least 300 passengers. Specifically, one X aircraft can carry 150 passengers, and one Y aircraft can carry 200 passengers. However, due to flight time and airport gate limitations, the combination of 2 X aircraft and 1 Y aircraft cannot exceed 5 flights per day.\\n\\nThe cost of operating an X aircraft is 5000 units, and the cost of operating a Y aircraft is 7000 units. Due to the indivisibility of aircraft, both types of aircraft must be flown in integer quantities.\\n\\nUnder these conditions, what is the minimum total cost that satisfies passenger transportation requirements while adhering to flight restrictions?

This is achieved by selecting specific tactical configurations to deal with different opponents and game scenarios, aiming for a more organized, flexible, and balanced approach in offense and defense.\\n\\nWe consider two primary tactical choices, indexed as 0 and 1, for a first tactical dimension, and two secondary tactical choices, also indexed as 0 and 1, for a second tactical dimension. The decision variables are binary: `S[i, j]` is 1 if the tactical configuration combining the `i`-th choice from the first dimension and the `j`-th choice from the second dimension is selected as part of the team's overall tactical system, and 0 otherwise. Thus, there are four possible tactical configurations: `S[0,0]`, `S[0,1]`, `S[1,0]`, and `S[1,1]`.\\n\\nOptimization Goals\\nThe objective is to maximize a weighted score that reflects the team's competitive level, considering winning rate, tactical system cost, and offensive/defensive balance. Specifically, the objective function aims to:\\n\\n-   **Maximize the winning rate:** This is weighted by the winning rate index `W[i][j]` for each selected tactical configuration `S[i,j]`. The winning rate indices are:\\n    -   `W[0][0] = 0.6`\\n    -   `W[0][1] = 0.7`\\n    -   `W[1][0] = 0.8`\\n    -   `W[1][1] = 0.9`\\n    The total winning rate contribution is `0.6*S[0,0] + 0.7*S[0,1] + 0.8*S[1,0] + 0.9*S[1,1]`.\\n\\n-   **Minimize the tactical system cost:** This is achieved by subtracting a weighted sum of the tactical system costs `C[i][j]` for each selected configuration `S[i,j]`. The costs are weighted by `alpha = 0.5`. The tactical system costs are:\\n    -   `C[0][0] = 0.3`\\n    -   `C[0][1] = 0.2`\\n    -   `C[1][0] = 0.4`\\n    -   `C[1][1] = 0.3`\\n    The total cost penalty is `0.5 * (0.3*S[0,0] + 0.2*S[0,1] + 0.4*S[1,0] + 0.3*S[1,1])`.\\n\\n-   **Minimize offensive and defensive imbalance:** This is achieved by subtracting a weighted sum of the offensive and defensive imbalance indices `R[i][j]` for each selected configuration `S[i,j]`. A higher `R` value signifies greater imbalance. This is weighted by `beta = 0.3`. The imbalance indices are:\\n    -   `R[0][0] = 0.2`\\n    -   `R[0][1] = 0.3`\\n    -   `R[1][0] = 0.3`\\n    -   `R[1][1] = 0.4`\\n    The total imbalance penalty is `0.3 * (0.2*S[0,0] + 0.3*S[0,1] + 0.3*S[1,0] + 0.4*S[1,1])`.\\n\\nThe overall objective function to maximize is:\\n`MAXIMIZE (0.6*S[0,0] + 0.7*S[0,1] + 0.8*S[1,0] + 0.9*S[1,1]) - 0.5*(0.3*S[0,0] + 0.2*S[0,1] + 0.4*S[1,0] + 0.3*S[1,1]) - 0.3*(0.2*S[0,0] + 0.3*S[0,1] + 0.3*S[1,0] + 0.4*S[1,1])`\\n\\nProblem Constraints\\nThe selection of tactical configurations is subject to the following constraints:\\n\\n-   **Player skill constraints:** For each choice `i` from the first tactical dimension (0 or 1), the sum of player participation levels `P[i][j]` for the selected configurations `S[i,j]` across all choices `j` from the second dimension must meet a minimum threshold `P_min = 1.0`. The player participation levels are:\\n    -   `P[0][0] = 0.8`, `P[0][1] = 0.6`\\n    -   `P[1][0] = 0.7`, `P[1][1] = 0.9`\\n    The constraints are:\\n    -   For `i=0`: `0.8*S[0,0] + 0.6*S[0,1] >= 1.0`\\n    -   For `i=1`: `0.7*S[1,0] + 0.9*S[1,1] >= 1.0`\\n\\n-   **Opponent analysis constraints:** For each choice `j` from the second tactical dimension (0 or 1), the sum of the probabilities `O[i][j]` of effectively responding to an opponent adopting a tactical system (or characteristic) associated with `j`, based on our selected configurations `S[i,j]` across all choices `i` from the first dimension, must meet a minimum threshold `O_min = 0.8`. The opponent response probabilities are:\\n    -   `O[0][0] = 0.5`, `O[0][1] = 0.4`\\n    -   `O[1][0] = 0.6`, `O[1][1] = 0.7`\\n    The constraints are:\\n    -   For `j=0`: `0.5*S[0,0] + 0.6*S[1,0] >= 0.8`\\n    -   For `j=1`: `0.4*S[0,1] + 0.7*S[1,1] >= 0.8`\\n\\nAll decision variables `S[i,j]` are binary, meaning they can only take values of 0 or 1.\",\n",

This network consists of **2 distinct network entities**, identified numerically as **entity 1** and **entity 2**.

The objective is to strategically expand the network to meet future data traffic demands effectively, balance expansion costs, and ensure a specified quality of service.\\n\\n**Optimization Goals**\\nThe overall objective is to **minimize a composite cost function**.

This is a common challenge in the catering industry, especially during peak dining periods.\\n\\n**Optimization Goals**\\nThe objective is to **maximize** the total weighted sum of allocated seats. Each allocated seat contributes to both customer satisfaction and restaurant revenue. The combined weight for each allocated seat is calculated as the sum of the satisfaction coefficient and the revenue coefficient. Specifically, with a satisfaction coefficient of **1** and a revenue coefficient of **2**, each allocated seat contributes **3** units to the objective function.\\n\\n**Decision Variables**\\nWe define integer decision variables `x_ij`, where `i` represents the time period (from the set `{1, 2}`) and `j` is an index (also from the set `{1, 2}`) representing an abstract allocation component. These variables `x_ij` denote the number of seats allocated for time period `i` corresponding to allocation component `j`. All `x_ij` must be non-negative integers.\\n\\n**Problem Constraints**\\nThe allocation must satisfy the following conditions:\\n\\n1.  **Restaurant space limitations:** Considering the actual number of seats in the restaurant, the seat allocation at any given time period must not exceed the available capacity. The **total number of seats in the restaurant is 10**.\\n    *   For time period 1: `x_11 + x_12 <= 10`\\n    *   For time period 2: `x_21 + x_22 <= 10`\\n\\n2.  **Fluctuation in demand at different times:** There are fluctuations in customers' demand for seats at different times, which need to be flexibly responded to. The total seats allocated for each time period must fall within a specified minimum and maximum demand range.\\n    *   For time period 1: The total seats allocated must be between a **minimum demand of 2 seats** and a **maximum demand of 5 seats**.\\n        *   `2 <= x_11 + x_12 <= 5`\\n    *   For time period 2: The total seats allocated must be between a **minimum demand of 3 seats** and a **maximum demand of 7 seats**.\\n        *   `3 <= x_21 + x_22 <= 7`\",\n",

Safety stock is considered a management method that can effectively prevent stockouts and deal with uncertain demand. In this simplified scenario, we consider two interconnected nodes, **Node 1** and **Node 2**, which are potential locations for safety stock. The model takes into account the interdependence of supply times between these nodes and the sharing of supply chain risks.\\n\\n## Problem Description\\nThis problem aims to optimize a two-node segment of a food company's distribution supply chain network. The network consists of **Node 1** and **Node 2**.\\n\\nThe following numerical parameters define the characteristics of these two nodes:\\n\\n*   **Node 1:**\\n    *   **Inventory Holding Cost (`h_1`):** $2 per unit.\\n    *   **Upper Bound Function of Demand (`D_1(t)`):** `10 + 2*t` (where `t` is time). This function represents the maximum demand that needs to be covered over a given time duration `t`.\\n    *   **Mean Demand (`mu_1`):** 1 unit per unit of time.\\n    *   **Lead Time (`L_1`):** 3 units of time (e.g., days, weeks) for replenishment from its upstream source.\\n    *   **Service Level Agreement (`sla_1`):** 5 units of time. This is the maximum allowed time for fulfilling an order from Node 1 to its customers.\\n\\n*   **Node 2:**\\n    *   **Inventory Holding Cost (`h_2`):** $3 per unit.\\n    *   **Upper Bound Function of Demand (`D_2(t)`):** `15 + 1.5*t` (where `t` is time).\\n    *   **Mean Demand (`mu_2`):** 1.2 units per unit of time.\\n    *   **Lead Time (`L_2`):** 2 units of time for replenishment from its upstream source.\\n    *   **Service Level Agreement (`sla_2`):** 4 units of time.\\n\\nThe decision variables for each node `j` (where `j` belongs to the set {1, 2}) are:\\n*   `S_j`: **Service Time** at node `j`. This represents the time taken from when an order is placed at node `j` until the goods are delivered from node `j` to its customers. It is a continuous variable.\\n*   `SI_j`: **Safety Interval** at node `j`. This represents the duration of time that node `j` can cover demand from its safety stock, considering upstream dependencies. It is a continuous variable.\\n*   `CT_j`: **Critical Time** at node `j`. This represents the total cumulative lead time (including upstream safety intervals) that node `j` needs to protect against. It is a continuous variable.\\n\\nThe interaction between the nodes is captured by a specific constraint:\\n*   The **Safety Interval of Node 2 (`SI_2`)** must be greater than or equal to the **Service Time of Node 1 (`S_1`)**. This implies a dependency where Node 1 is an upstream node or influences the replenishment of Node 2.\\n\\n## Problem Objective\\nThe objective is to minimize the total inventory holding cost of safety stock across both nodes. The safety stock quantity at each node `j` is calculated as the difference between the upper bound of demand over its critical time (`D_j(CT_j)`) and the mean demand over the same critical time (`CT_j * mu_j`).\\n\\nMathematically, the objective is to:\\n**Minimize:** `h_1 * (D_1(CT_1) - CT_1 * mu_1) + h_2 * (D_2(CT_2) - CT_2 * mu_2)`\\n\\nSubstituting the numerical values:\\n**Minimize:** `2 * ((10 + 2*CT_1) - CT_1 * 1) + 3 * ((15 + 1.5*CT_2) - CT_2 * 1.2)`\\n**Minimize:** `2 * (10 + CT_1) + 3 * (15 + 0.3*CT_2)`\\n**Minimize:** `20 + 2*CT_1 + 45 + 0.9*CT_2`\\n**Minimize:** `65 + 2*CT_1 + 0.9*CT_2`\\n\\n## Constraints\\nThe optimization must satisfy the following conditions:\\n\\n1.  **Critical Time Definition:** For each node `j`, the Critical Time (`CT_j`) is defined by its Safety Interval (`SI_j`), its Lead Time (`L_j`), and its Service Time (`S_j`).\\n    *   For **Node 1**: `CT_1 = SI_1 + 3 - S_1`\\n    *   For **Node 2**: `CT_2 = SI_2 + 2 - S_2`\\n\\n2.  **Upstream/Downstream Safety Coordination:** The Safety Interval of Node 2 must be at least the Service Time of Node 1.\\n    *   `SI_2 - S_1 >= 0`\\n\\n3.  **Service Time (SLA) Limits:** The Service Time at each node `j` cannot exceed its predefined Service Level Agreement (`sla_j`).\\n    *   For **Node 1**: `S_1 <= 5`\\n    *   For **Node 2**: `S_2 <= 4`\\n\\n4.  **Non-Negativity:** All decision variables must be non-negative.\\n    *   `S_1 >= 0`, `S_2 >= 0`\\n    *   `SI_1 >= 0`, `SI_2 >= 0`\\n    *   `CT_1 >= 0`, `CT_2 >= 0`\\n\\nThe problem seeks to determine the optimal values for `S_j`, `SI_j`, and `CT_j` for both Node 1 and Node 2 that minimize the total safety stock holding cost while adhering to these operational and service level constraints.\",\n",

We are dealing with **2 cars** that require parking and **3 distinct parking spaces** available for allocation. The objective is to plan the parking assignments to make the most efficient use of these spaces.\\\\n\\\\n**Optimization Objectives:**\\\\nThe primary objective is to **maximize the sum of utilization scores** for the available parking spaces. Each parking space `j` is associated with a continuous \"utilization score\" variable, `u[j]`, which can range from `0` (no utilization) to `1` (full utilization). The problem seeks to maximize the total sum: `u[0] + u[1] + u[2]`.\\\\n\\\\n**Decision Variables:**\\\\n1.  **Car-to-Space Assignment (`x[i,j]`):** These are binary variables, where:\\\\n    *   `x[i,j] = 1` if car `i` is assigned to parking space `j`.\\\\n    *   `x[i,j] = 0` otherwise.\\\\n    *   The index `i` represents the cars, taking values `0` and `1` (total of 2 cars).\\\\n    *   The index `j` represents the parking spaces, taking values `0`, `1`, and `2` (total of 3 parking spaces).\\\\n2.  **Parking Space Utilization Score (`u[j]`):** These are continuous variables, where:\\\\n    *   `u[j]` represents a score related to the utilization of parking space `j`.\\\\n    *   The index `j` represents the parking spaces, taking values `0`, `1`, and `2` (total of 3 parking spaces).\\\\n    *   Each `u[j]` must be between `0` and `1`, inclusive (`0 <= u[j] <= 1`).\\\\n\\\\n**Problem Constraints:**\\\\n1.  **Car Assignment Constraint:** Each of the **2 cars** must be assigned to exactly one parking space.\\\\n    *   For Car 0: `x[0,0] + x[0,1] + x[0,2] = 1`\\\\n    *   For Car 1: `x[1,0] + x[1,1] + x[1,2] = 1`\\\\n2.  **Parking Space Capacity Constraint:** Each of the **3 parking spaces** has a maximum capacity limit of **1 car**.\\\\n    *   For Parking Space 0: `x[0,0] + x[1,0] <= 1`\\\\n    *   For Parking Space 1: `x[0,1] + x[1,1] <= 1`\\\\n    *   For Parking Space 2: `x[0,2] + x[1,2] <= 1`\\\\n3.  **Utilization Score Bounds:** The utilization score for each parking space is bounded between `0` and `1`.\\\\n    *   `0 <= u[0] <= 1`\\\\n    *   `0 <= u[1] <= 1`\\\\n    *   `0 <= u[2] <= 1`\\\\n\\\\n**Unmodeled Constraints:**\\\\nThe original problem description includes \"Passageway width constraint\" and \"Safety distance constraint\", but these are explicitly stated as not being modeled in the provided COPT code and are therefore not included in this numerical optimization problem formulation.\\\\n\\\\n**Interpretation and Potential Discrepancy:**\\\\nAs implemented in the provided COPT code, there are no explicit constraints that link the `u[j]` utilization score variables directly to the `x[i,j]` car assignment variables. This implies that the solver will independently attempt to set each `u[j]` to its maximum possible value of `1` to maximize the objective, irrespective of whether a car is actually assigned to parking space `j` via the `x` variables. If the intent was for `u[j]` to strictly represent the actual utilization (e.g., `1` if space `j` is occupied by a car, `0` if empty, given its capacity of 1), additional linking constraints (such as `u[j] == x[0,j] + x[1,j]`) would be necessary in the model.',\n",

A bank needs to choose the best few from 2 potential locations to establish new branches. These potential locations are identified as Location 1 and Location 2. The goal is to maximize market coverage and profits, while considering cost control and risk management. This problem considers geographical location, potential customer base, competitor distribution, construction and operation costs, and legal/regulatory restrictions.\\\\n\\\\nOptimization Objective\\\\nMaximize the total expected profits from new branches. The expected profit for opening a branch at Location 1 is 30 units, and for Location 2 is 40 units.\\\\n\\\\nDecision Variables\\\\nFor each potential location `i` (where `i` can be 1 or 2), let `x_i` be a binary decision variable:\\\\n- `x_i = 1` if a new branch is established at Location `i`.\\\\n- `x_i = 0` otherwise.\\\\n\\\\nProblem Constraints\\\\n1.  **Budget constraint:** The total construction and operation costs of new branches should not exceed a predetermined budget of 100 units.\\\\n    - The construction and operation cost for Location 1 is 50 units.\\\\n    - The construction and operation cost for Location 2 is 60 units.\\\\n    - Mathematically: `50 * x_1 + 60 * x_2 <= 100`\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Geographic constraint:** New branches must be distributed within the area permitted by laws and regulations.\\\\n    - Location 2 is an illegal location; a branch cannot be opened there.\\\\n    - Mathematically: `x_2 = 0`\\\\n\\\\n3.  **Competition constraint:** The location selection of new branches should consider avoiding direct competition with existing bank branches and competitors.\\\\n    - There is a competitive relationship between Location 1 and Location 2, meaning a branch cannot be opened at both locations simultaneously.\\\\n    - Mathematically: `x_1 + x_2 <= 1`\\\\n\\\\n4.  **Service coverage constraint:** Ensure that new branches can cover the maximum number of potential customers. The minimum required service coverage is 50 units.\\\\n    - The coverage provided by a branch depends on its distance to potential customer areas. Let's assume customer areas are also indexed by 1 and 2. The distance from a potential branch `i` to customer area `j` is given by the following matrix:\\\\n        - Distance from Location 1 to Customer Area 1: 10 units.\\\\n        - Distance from Location 1 to Customer Area 2: 20 units.\\\\n        - Distance from Location 2 to Customer Area 1: 15 units.\\\\n        - Distance from Location 2 to Customer Area 2: 25 units.\\\\n    - The coverage function is defined as `max(0, 100 - d)`, where `d` is the distance.\\\\n    - The total coverage contributed by a selected branch `i` is the sum of its coverage to all customer areas `j`.\\\\n        - Coverage from Location 1 to Customer Area 1: `max(0, 100 - 10) = 90`\\\\n        - Coverage from Location 1 to Customer Area 2: `max(0, 100 - 20) = 80`\\\\n        - Coverage from Location 2 to Customer Area 1: `max(0, 100 - 15) = 85`\\\\n        - Coverage from Location 2 to Customer Area 2: `max(0, 100 - 25) = 75`\\\\n    - The total service coverage from selected branches must be at least 50 units.\\\\n    - Mathematically: `(90 + 80) * x_1 + (85 + 75) * x_2 >= 50` which simplifies to `170 * x_1 + 160 * x_2 >= 50`\",\n",

This optimization problem aims to design personalized, cost-effective treatment pathways for **two specific chronic disease patients**, Patient 1 and Patient 2, over **two distinct time periods**, Time Period 1 and Time Period 2.\\n\\nDecision Variables:\\n*   **Treatment Pathway Intensity (x_it):** For each Patient `i` (where `i` can be Patient 1 or Patient 2) and each Time Period `t` (where `t` can be Time Period 1 or Time Period 2), we define a continuous decision variable `x_it`. This variable represents the \"extent\" or \"intensity\" of applying the designed treatment pathway for Patient `i` in Time Period `t`. The value of `x_it` can range from **0** (no application or zero intensity) to **1** (full application or maximum intensity).\\n*   **Resource Slack (s_k):** For each of the **two types of medical resources** (Resource 1 and Resource 2), we define a continuous slack variable `s_k`. This variable represents the amount of the respective resource `k` that remains unused. These slack variables must be **non-negative**.\\n\\nParameters:\\n*   **Treatment Pathway Costs (C_it and c_it):** The cost associated with applying the treatment pathway for Patient `i` in Time Period `t` is as follows:\\n    *   Patient 1, Time Period 1: **5 units**\\n    *   Patient 2, Time Period 1: **6 units**\\n    *   Patient 1, Time Period 2: **4 units**\\n    *   Patient 2, Time Period 2: **5 units**\\n*   **Health Outcome Improvement (H_it):** The health outcome improvement achieved by applying the treatment pathway for Patient `i` in Time Period `t` is:\\n    *   Patient 1, Time Period 1: **3 units**\\n    *   Patient 2, Time Period 1: **4 units**\\n    *   Patient 1, Time Period 2: **5 units**\\n    *   Patient 2, Time Period 2: **6 units**\\n*   **Weight for Health Outcome (λ):** The importance of maximizing health outcomes in the objective function is weighted by **λ = 1**.\\n*   **Penalty for Resource Slack (ρ):** A penalty of **ρ = 0.5** is incurred for each unit of unused resource, contributing to the total cost.\\n*   **Treatment Plan Compatibility Factors (c_ijt):** These parameters define specific interactions or considerations among treatment pathways. A value of **1** indicates a significant interaction for the combination of Patient `i` (as the reference), Patient `j` (as the interacting patient), and Time Period `t`. A value of **0** indicates no such interaction for the purpose of this constraint.

Your goal is to determine the most cost-effective way to route packages from a starting hub (`node_0`) to a destination hub (`node_7`). Each hub is connected to others via specific delivery routes (arcs), and each route has an associated cost based on factors like distance, fuel consumption, and operational expenses.\\n\\nHere’s the breakdown of the scenario:\\n\\n1. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of routing packages from `node_0` to `node_7`. The cost of using each route is fixed and known in advance. For example:\\n   - Sending a package from `node_0` to `node_1` costs 7 units.\\n   - Sending a package from `node_0` to `node_2` costs 2 units.\\n   - Sending a package from `node_1` to `node_0` costs 9 units.\\n   - Similarly, all other routes have specific costs, such as 14 units for `node_0` to `node_5`, 5 units for `node_0` to `node_7`, and so on.\\n\\n2. **Constraints**:\\n   - **Flow Balance at Each Hub**: The number of packages entering a hub must equal the number of packages leaving it, except for the starting hub (`node_0`) and the destination hub (`node_7`). Specifically:\\n     - At `node_0`, there is a net outflow of 1 package (indicating the start of the delivery).\\n     - At `node_7`, there is a net inflow of 1 package (indicating the end of the delivery).\\n     - For all other hubs (`node_1` to `node_6`), the inflow and outflow must balance perfectly (net flow = 0).\\n   - **Binary Decisions**: Each route can either be used (1) or not used (0) for package delivery. There is no partial usage of routes.\\n\\n3. **Route Costs**:\\n   - The costs for all possible routes are provided. For instance:\\n     - From `node_0` to `node_3`: 1 unit.\\n     - From `node_1` to `node_2`: 1 unit.\\n     - From `node_2` to `node_3`: 5 units.\\n     - From `node_3` to `node_7`: 9 units.\\n     - From `node_4` to `node_7`: 15 units.\\n     - From `node_5` to `node_7`: 1 unit.\\n     - From `node_6` to `node_7`: 5 units.\\n   - These costs are fixed and must be considered when determining the optimal path.\\n\\n4. **Key Considerations**:\\n   - The problem requires selecting a sequence of routes that connects `node_0` to `node_7` while ensuring the flow balance constraints are met at every intermediate hub.\\n   - The total cost of the selected routes must be minimized.\\n   - Only one package is being routed, so the solution will identify the single cheapest path from start to finish.\\n\\n5. **Numerical Parameters**:\\n   - All route costs are explicitly defined, such as 7 units for `node_0` to `node_1`, 2 units for `node_0` to `node_2`, 1 unit for `node_0` to `node_3`, and so on.\\n   - The flow balance constraints are numerically precise, with `node_0` requiring a net outflow of 1 and `node_7` requiring a net inflow of 1.\\n\\nYour task is to determine the optimal sequence of routes that delivers the package from `node_0` to `node_7` at the lowest possible total cost, while ensuring all flow balance constraints are satisfied and only whole routes are used.',\n",

Each factory has unique operational costs, production capacities, and constraints. Your goal is to minimize the total cost of running the factories while ensuring that the monthly demand for products is met.\\n\\n#### Key Decisions:\\n1. **Run Decision**: For each month and each factory, you must decide whether to operate the factory (1) or keep it idle (0). This decision incurs a fixed cost based on the factory and the month.\\n2. **Production Level**: If a factory is operational in a given month, you must determine the exact amount of product it will produce. Each factory has a minimum and maximum production capacity that must be respected.\\n\\n#### Objective:\\nMinimize the total cost, which includes:\\n- **Fixed Costs**: Costs incurred for operating each factory in a given month. These costs vary by factory and month. For example:\\n  - Operating Factory 0 in any month costs 662 units.\\n  - Operating Factory 1 in any month costs 573 units.\\n  - Operating Factory 2 in any month costs 556 units.\\n  - Operating Factory 3 in any month costs 533 units.\\n  - Operating Factory 4 in any month costs 513 units.\\n  - Operating Factory 5 in any month costs 502 units.\\n- **Variable Costs**: Costs associated with the actual production levels. These costs also vary by factory and month. For example:\\n  - Producing at Factory 0 in any month costs 10 units per unit produced.\\n  - Producing at Factory 1 in any month costs 11 units per unit produced.\\n  - Producing at Factory 2 in any month costs 12 units per unit produced.\\n  - Producing at Factory 3 in any month costs 12 units per unit produced.\\n  - Producing at Factory 4 in any month costs 8 units per unit produced.\\n  - Producing at Factory 5 in any month costs 9 units per unit produced.\\n\\n#### Constraints:\\n1. **Minimum Production**: If a factory is operational in a given month, it must produce at least a certain amount of product. For example:\\n   - Factory 0 must produce at least 63 units if operational.\\n   - Factory 1 must produce at least 61 units if operational.\\n   - Factory 2 must produce at least 61 units if operational.\\n   - Factory 3 must produce at least 63 units if operational.\\n   - Factory 4 must produce at least 67 units if operational.\\n   - Factory 5 must produce at least 69 units if operational.\\n2. **Maximum Production**: If a factory is operational in a given month, it cannot exceed its maximum production capacity. For example:\\n   - Factory 0 cannot produce more than 167 units.\\n   - Factory 1 cannot produce more than 154 units.\\n   - Factory 2 cannot produce more than 157 units.\\n   - Factory 3 cannot produce more than 148 units.\\n   - Factory 4 cannot produce more than 157 units.\\n   - Factory 5 cannot produce more than 158 units.\\n3. **Demand Satisfaction**: The total production across all factories in each month must meet or exceed the monthly demand. The demands are as follows:\\n   - Month 0: 299 units.\\n   - Month 1: 291 units.\\n   - Month 2: 284 units.\\n   - Month 3: 291 units.\\n   - Month 4: 286 units.\\n\\n#### Summary:\\nYour task is to determine the optimal schedule for running the factories and the corresponding production levels for each month to minimize the total cost while ensuring all production constraints and demand requirements are met. The decisions must account for the fixed and variable costs, as well as the minimum and maximum production capacities of each factory.',\n",

To achieve this, they aim to develop an enhanced risk assessment model that can accurately identify patients at low risk of readmission within 30 days, thereby allowing for targeted post-discharge care for higher-risk individuals. The hospital's data analytics team has identified three key predictive factors and, based on historical patient outcomes and extensive data analysis, has pre-processed these into 'low-risk contribution scores' for a sample set of patients.\\\\n\\\\n### Predictive Factors:\\\\n1.  **Factor 1 (Demographic & Lifestyle Score)**: Aggregated score reflecting a patient's age, socioeconomic status, and general lifestyle indicators. A higher score in this factor indicates a lower readmission risk.\\\\n2.  **Factor 2 (Clinical Comorbidity Score)**: Aggregated score reflecting the number and severity of chronic conditions, previous hospitalizations, and other clinical markers. A higher score indicates a lower readmission risk.\\\\n3.  **Factor 3 (Treatment & Recovery Score)**: Aggregated score reflecting the patient's immediate response to surgery, length of hospital stay, and early recovery milestones. A higher score indicates a lower readmission risk.\\\\n\\\\n### Historical Patient Data:\\\\nThe following table presents the pre-processed 'low-risk contribution scores' for five historical patients (P1 to P5) across the three identified predictive factors. These scores represent how much each factor for a given patient contributes to their overall low-risk assessment, based on prior analysis of actual readmission outcomes.

This problem aims to optimize the portfolio allocation of **2** AR technology-related companies (Company 1 and Company 2) through operational research methods, achieving maximum economic returns while satisfying certain risk control. The investor\\\\\\'s initial capital available for investment is **100** units.\\\\n\\\\nOptimization Goal\\\\nMaximize the total economic return of the AR technology-related investment portfolio. Let `x_1` be the proportion of the total portfolio invested in Company 1, and `x_2` be the proportion of the total portfolio invested in Company 2. The expected return rate for Company 1 is **0.1**, and for Company 2 is **0.2**. The objective is to maximize:\\\\n`0.1 * x_1 + 0.2 * x_2`\\\\n\\\\nProblem Constraints\\\\n1.  **Risk control constraint**: The total risk of the portfolio must not exceed the preset risk tolerance. The risk (standard deviation) associated with Company 1 is **0.05**, and for Company 2 is **0.07**. The preset risk tolerance (maximum allowable standard deviation) for the portfolio is **0.08**. This is modeled such that the sum of the squared investment proportions multiplied by their respective squared risks must not exceed the squared risk tolerance:\\\\n    `x_1 * (0.05)^2 + x_2 * (0.07)^2 <= (0.08)^2`\\\\n    Which numerically evaluates to:\\\\n    `x_1 * 0.0025 + x_2 * 0.0049 <= 0.0064`\\\\n2.  **Investment ratio constraint**: The investment ratio of a single company must not exceed a certain percentage of the total portfolio to avoid excessive concentration. For any single company, its proportion in the investment portfolio must not exceed **0.5** (50%).\\\\n    `x_1 <= 0.5`\\\\n    `x_2 <= 0.5`\\\\n3.  **Budget constraint**: The total investment must not exceed the investor\\\\\\'s initial capital.

Each crate weighs **28 units**, and each container has a maximum capacity of **100 units**. Your goal is to minimize the number of containers used while ensuring that all crates are packed and no container exceeds its capacity.\\n\\nHere’s the breakdown of the problem:\\n\\n1. **Crates and Containers**:  \\n   - There are **10 crates**, each weighing **28 units**.  \\n   - You have access to **10 containers**, each with a capacity of **100 units**.  \\n\\n2. **Objective**:  \\n   - Minimize the total number of containers used to pack all the crates.  \\n\\n3. **Constraints**:  \\n   - **Capacity Constraint**: The total weight of crates assigned to any container cannot exceed **100 units**. For example, if a container is used, the combined weight of the crates placed in it must be less than or equal to **100 units**.  \\n   - **Assignment Constraint**: Each crate must be assigned to exactly one container. No crate can be left unpacked or split across multiple containers.  \\n\\n4. **Decision Variables**:  \\n   - For each crate, you must decide which container it will be assigned to.  \\n   - For each container, you must decide whether it will be used (i.e., whether at least one crate is assigned to it).  \\n\\n5. **Key Considerations**:  \\n   - Since each crate weighs **28 units**, a single container can hold up to **3 crates** (as 3 × 28 = 84 ≤ 100), but not 4 crates (as 4 × 28 = 112 > 100).  \\n   - The challenge is to assign the crates to containers in such a way that the number of containers used is as small as possible, while respecting the capacity and assignment constraints.  \\n\\n6. **Example Scenario**:  \\n   - If you assign 3 crates to one container, the remaining 7 crates would require at least 3 more containers (since 7 ÷ 3 ≈ 2.33, rounded up to 3). This would result in a total of **4 containers** used.  \\n   - However, the optimal solution might involve a different distribution of crates across containers to further reduce the total number of containers used.  \\n\\nYour task is to determine the optimal assignment of crates to containers to achieve the minimum number of containers used while satisfying all the constraints.',\n",

The scenario involves two distinct types of materials (referred to as Material 1 and Material 2) and two construction project stages (referred to as Project Stage 1 and Project Stage 2).\\n\\n**Decision Variables:**\\nThe decisions are represented by four binary variables:\\n*   `x_recycle[1]`: A binary variable equal to 1 if Material 1 is selected for recycling and reuse, and 0 otherwise.\\n*   `x_recycle[2]`: A binary variable equal to 1 if Material 2 is selected for recycling and reuse, and 0 otherwise.\\n*   `x_new[1]`: A binary variable equal to 1 if new Material 1 is procured, and 0 otherwise.\\n*   `x_new[2]`: A binary variable equal to 1 if new Material 2 is procured, and 0 otherwise.\\n\\n**Optimization Objective:**\\nThe primary objective is to maximize the overall net benefit, which is calculated by summing the benefits gained from recycling and reusing materials and subtracting the costs associated with procuring new materials.\\nMaximize: `(10 * x_recycle[1] - 5 * x_new[1]) + (20 * x_recycle[2] - 10 * x_new[2])`\\n\\n**Problem Constraints:**\\n\\n**1. Material Supply Constraints:**\\nThese constraints ensure that for each project stage, the total available quantity of materials chosen for recycling and reuse does not exceed the total material resources allocated to that specific project stage.\\n*   For Project Stage 1: The sum of 10 units of recycled Material 1 (if chosen) and 20 units of recycled Material 2 (if chosen) must not exceed 30 units of total available material resources for Project Stage 1.\\n    `10 * x_recycle[1] + 20 * x_recycle[2] <= 30`\\n*   For Project Stage 2: The sum of 15 units of recycled Material 1 (if chosen) and 25 units of recycled Material 2 (if chosen) must not exceed 40 units of total available material resources for Project Stage 2.\\n    `15 * x_recycle[1] + 25 * x_recycle[2] <= 40`\\n\\n**2. Technical Requirements Constraints:**\\nThese constraints specify minimum technical requirements that must be met if a material is chosen for recycling. The technical requirement for a material is aggregated across both project stages.\\n*   For Material 1: If Material 1 is chosen for recycling (`x_recycle[1]=1`), its combined technical requirement of 5 units for Project Stage 1 and 10 units for Project Stage 2 must be greater than or equal to its minimum technical requirement of 8 units. This simplifies to `15 * x_recycle[1] >= 8`. Given `x_recycle[1]` is binary, this constraint effectively forces `x_recycle[1]` to be 1.\\n*   For Material 2: If Material 2 is chosen for recycling (`x_recycle[2]=1`), its combined technical requirement of 15 units for Project Stage 1 and 20 units for Project Stage 2 must be greater than or equal to its minimum technical requirement of 18 units. This simplifies to `35 * x_recycle[2] >= 18`. Given `x_recycle[2]` is binary, this constraint effectively forces `x_recycle[2]` to be 1.\\n\\n**3. Environmental Impact Constraints:**\\nThese constraints set maximum limits on the environmental impact generated by the chosen recycled materials for each project stage.\\n*   For Project Stage 1: The sum of 1 unit of environmental impact from recycled Material 1 (if chosen) and 2 units from recycled Material 2 (if chosen) must not exceed a maximum limit of 5 units for Project Stage 1.\\n    `1 * x_recycle[1] + 2 * x_recycle[2] <= 5`\\n*   For Project Stage 2: The sum of 2 units of environmental impact from recycled Material 1 (if chosen) and 3 units from recycled Material 2 (if chosen) must not exceed a maximum limit of 7 units for Project Stage 2.\\n    `2 * x_recycle[1] + 3 * x_recycle[2] <= 7`\\n\\n**Variable Bounds:**\\nAll decision variables (`x_recycle[1]`, `x_recycle[2]`, `x_new[1]`, `x_new[2]`) are binary, meaning they can only take a value of 0 or 1.',\n",

This new section is divided into two distinct Development Zones: 'Adventure Land' (Z1) and 'Mystic Valley' (Z2). The management team needs to decide on the optimal allocation of three primary Attraction Types across these zones to maximize the estimated total daily revenue from the new section.\\n\\nThe three Attraction Types under consideration are:\\n*   **Type A:** Thrill Coaster\\n*   **Type B:** Water Adventure\\n*   **Type C:** Interactive Story\\n\\nFor planning purposes, the scale of each attraction is measured in 'Development Units.' These units represent a standardized measure of investment, space utilization, and operational complexity, allowing for continuous allocation. For example, 1 unit of a Thrill Coaster represents a certain scale of the ride, and 0.5 units would imply a smaller, scaled-down version of that ride or a partial investment into its full capacity, yielding proportional revenue.\\n\\n### Data Description:\\n\\n**1. Estimated Daily Revenue per Development Unit:**\\nEach Development Unit of an attraction type generates a specific estimated daily revenue, which can vary depending on the zone due to thematic synergy, visitor flow patterns, and other operational factors. The estimated daily revenue (in USD) per Development Unit is as follows:\\n\\n| Attraction Type | Adventure Land (Z1) | Mystic Valley (Z2) |\\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------|\\n| Thrill Coaster (A) | $1200             | $900               |\\n| Water Adventure (B) | $1000             | $1100              |\\n| Interactive Story (C) | $800              | $1300              |\\n\\n**2. Zone Development Capacity:**\\nEach Development Zone has a maximum capacity for the total number of Development Units it can accommodate, limited by available land, infrastructure, and budget for that zone:\\n\\n*   **Adventure Land (Z1):** Can accommodate a maximum of **100** total Development Units.\\n*   **Mystic Valley (Z2):** Can accommodate a maximum of **80** total Development Units.\\n\\n**3. Overall Attraction Type Limits:**\\nDue to factors such as specialized construction requirements, availability of technology, and overall budget constraints for each attraction type across the entire new section, there are limits on the total number of Development Units for each attraction type across *both* zones combined:\\n\\n*   **Thrill Coaster (A):** The total Development Units allocated for Thrill Coasters across both zones cannot exceed **70** units.\\n*   **Water Adventure (B):** The total Development Units allocated for Water Adventures across both zones cannot exceed **60** units.\\n*   **Interactive Story (C):** The total Development Units allocated for Interactive Story attractions across both zones cannot exceed **90** units.\\n\\n### Optimization Objective:\\nDetermine the optimal number of Development Units for each attraction type in each zone to maximize the total estimated daily revenue for the new section of 'FuturePlay' complex, while adhering to all development capacities and overall attraction limits.

To ensure the success and quality of its projects, MegaBuild is developing an optimized system for evaluating potential sub-contractors before awarding contracts. The firm aims to establish an optimal weighting scheme for various performance indicators to maximize the overall quality assessment of its sub-contractor pool, effectively creating a 'project-credit score' for each sub-contractor. \\n\\nMegaBuild has identified four critical performance indicators (factors) for sub-contractor evaluation:\\n*   **F1: Past Project Performance:** This factor considers a sub-contractor's historical record regarding on-time and on-budget project completion rates.\\n*   **F2: Financial Health:** This factor assesses the sub-contractor's financial stability, liquidity, and overall capacity to sustain operations throughout a project.\\n*   **F3: Technical Capability:** This factor evaluates the sub-contractor's specialized skills, relevant certifications, and specific technical expertise pertinent to MegaBuild's projects.\\n*   **F4: Safety Record:** This factor reviews the sub-contractor's adherence to safety standards, incident history, and overall commitment to workplace safety.\\n\\nThe firm has rigorously evaluated four potential sub-contractors (S1, S2, S3, S4) based on these four factors.

The four key predictive factors under consideration are:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Factor 1 (FICO Score Equivalent):** A standardized measure reflecting an applicant's credit history and reliability.\\\\n*   **Factor 2 (Debt-to-Income Ratio):** An indicator of an applicant's ability to manage monthly debt payments relative to their gross monthly income.\\\\n*   **Factor 3 (Years of Employment Stability):** The duration of an applicant's stable employment with current or recent employers.\\\\n*   **Factor 4 (On-time Payment History Index):** A composite index reflecting the consistency of an applicant's timely payments on previous credit obligations.\\\\n\\\\nBased on detailed statistical analysis of past lending outcomes, the research team has determined the 'predictive impact score' of each factor for each sample applicant. These scores represent how strongly and positively a specific factor's value for a given applicant contributes to their overall creditworthiness assessment. A higher numerical value signifies a greater positive influence on the prediction that the applicant is creditworthy.\\\\n\\\\nThe 'predictive impact scores' for each applicant and factor are presented in the table below:\\\\n\\\\n| Applicant \\\\\\\\ Factor | Factor 1 (FICO Score Equivalent) | Factor 2 (Debt-to-Income Ratio) | Factor 3 (Years of Employment Stability) | Factor 4 (On-time Payment History Index) |\\\\n| :----------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |\\\\n| **Applicant A**    | 0.8                              | 0.6                             | 0.7                                      | 0.9                                      |\\\\n| **Applicant B**    | 0.7                              | 0.4                             | 0.8                                      | 0.7                                      |\\\\n| **Applicant C**    | 0.6                              | 0.7                             | 0.6                                      | 0.8                                      |\\\\n\\\\nThe institution's objective is to optimize the weights assigned to each of these four predictive factors within their credit scoring model. Your task is to develop a comprehensive plan that assigns these weights such that the overall predictive capability of the model is maximized.\\\\n\\\\n**The 'overall predictive capability' is measured by the total sum of the weighted predictive impact scores across all three sample applicants.**\\\\n\\\\n**Specific conditions that must be satisfied for this optimization are:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  The sum of the weights assigned to all four factors (Factor 1, Factor 2, Factor 3, and Factor 4) must exactly equal 1. This ensures that the combined influence of all factors is fully accounted for in the model's structure.\\\\n2.  Each factor's individual weight must be a non-negative value. Factors are expected to contribute positively or neutrally to the credit assessment, not negatively.\",\n",

The objective is to efficiently manage production by considering task completion times, machine operating costs, and machine waiting costs, given specific numerical parameters for these elements.\\n\\n**Optimization Goals (Numerical Interpretation):**\\nThe optimization problem aims to minimize a composite objective function, which numerically translates the original goals as follows:\\n\\n1.  **Minimize the total sum of completion times for all tasks:** This objective component directly minimizes `(s_0 + 3) + (s_1 + 2)`, where `s_i` is the start time of Task `i` and the numbers 3 and 2 are the processing times for Task 0 and Task 1, respectively. This serves as a proxy for minimizing overall production time, though it is not equivalent to minimizing the Makespan (the maximum completion time among all tasks).\\n2.  **Minimize weighted machine-related costs:** This includes contributions from machine operation and machine waiting (idle) costs.\\n    *   The machine operation cost for Machine `j` is `10 * u_0` for Machine 0 and `15 * u_1` for Machine 1, where `u_j` is a continuous decision variable for Machine `j`.\\n    *   The machine waiting cost for Machine `j` is `5 * (1 - u_0)` for Machine 0 and `7 * (1 - u_1)` for Machine 1.\\n    *   Both operating and waiting cost components are weighted by a coefficient of 1.\\n    *   Crucially, since `u_j` is a continuous variable and its positive coefficients (10-5=5 for Machine 0, 15-7=8 for Machine 1) in the objective function (after simplification) drive it to its minimum possible value (0, as there are no lower bounds other than default non-negativity or linking constraints), the operating cost terms effectively become 0. The waiting cost terms become fixed values: `5` for Machine 0 and `7` for Machine 1. Therefore, this part of the objective effectively minimizes a constant sum of `5 + 7 = 12`.\\n3.  **Maximize resource utilization rate:** This original goal is not directly supported by the numerical implementation. The continuous variable `u_j`, which might conceptually represent utilization, is driven to 0 by the objective function\\'s structure, implying minimization of \"utilization\" rather than maximization, or its effective removal from the optimization\\'s influence.\\n\\n**Problem Parameters:**\\n\\n*   **Set of Tasks (T):** Two tasks, indexed as `T = {0, 1}`.\\n*   **Set of Machines (M):** Two machines, indexed as `M = {0, 1}`.\\n*   **Processing Times (`p_i`):**\\n    *   Task 0 requires `p_0 = 3` units of time.\\n    *   Task 1 requires `p_1 = 2` units of time.\\n*   **Maximum Available Time (`C_j`) for each machine (capacity):**\\n    *   Machine 0 has a maximum available time of `C_0 = 4` units.\\n    *   Machine 1 has a maximum available time of `C_1 = 5` units.\\n*   **Machine Operating Costs (`C_op_j`):**\\n    *   Operating cost for Machine 0 is `C_op_0 = 10` per unit of `u_0`.\\n    *   Operating cost for Machine 1 is `C_op_1 = 15` per unit of `u_1`.\\n*   **Machine Waiting Costs (`C_wait_j`):**\\n    *   Waiting cost for Machine 0 is `C_wait_0 = 5` per unit of `(1 - u_0)`.\\n    *   Waiting cost for Machine 1 is `C_wait_1 = 7` per unit of `(1 - u_1)`.\\n*   **Operating Cost Weight Coefficient (`alpha`):** `alpha = 1`.\\n*   **Waiting Cost Weight Coefficient (`beta`):** `beta = 1`.\\n\\n**Decision Variables:**\\n\\n*   `x_{i,j}`: A binary variable (0 or 1) for each task `i \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\}` and machine `j \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\}`. `x_{i,j} = 1` if Task `i` is assigned to be processed on Machine `j`, and `0` otherwise.\\n*   `s_i`: A continuous variable representing the start time of Task `i` for each `i \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\}`. These variables are non-negative (`s_i \\\\ge 0`).\\n*   `u_j`: A continuous variable for each machine `j \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\}`. These variables are non-negative (`u_j \\\\ge 0`) and are minimized by the objective function.\\n\\n**Objective Function:**\\nThe objective is to minimize `Z`:\\n`Z = (s_0 + p_0) + (s_1 + p_1) + alpha * (C_op_0 * u_0 + C_op_1 * u_1) + beta * (C_wait_0 * (1 - u_0) + C_wait_1 * (1 - u_1))`\\n\\nSubstituting the numerical parameters:\\nMinimize `Z = (s_0 + 3) + (s_1 + 2) + 1 * (10 * u_0 + 15 * u_1) + 1 * (5 * (1 - u_0) + 7 * (1 - u_1))`\\n\\nSimplifying the expression:\\nMinimize `Z = s_0 + s_1 + 5 + 10u_0 + 15u_1 + 5 - 5u_0 + 7 - 7u_1`\\nMinimize `Z = s_0 + s_1 + 5u_0 + 8u_1 + 17`\\n\\n**Constraints:**\\n\\n1.  **Machine Processing Capacity Constraint:** For each machine `j`, the total processing time of tasks assigned to it must not exceed its maximum available time `C_j`.\\n    *   For Machine 0: `x_{0,0} * 3 + x_{1,0} * 2 <= 4`\\n    *   For Machine 1: `x_{0,1} * 3 + x_{1,1} * 2 <= 5`\\n2.  **Task Processing Order Constraint:** Task 1 must start only after Task 0 has completed.\\n    *   `s_0 + 3 <= s_1`\\n\\n(Note: The numerical problem, as implemented, does not explicitly include constraints ensuring that each task is assigned to exactly one machine, nor does it constrain `u_j` to be a proportion of machine utilization or link it to the actual work performed on the machine, beyond its role in the objective function.)',\n",

The company aims to optimize its vehicle deployment strategy to maximize its total net profit over the next four-week planning period (Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4).\\\\n\\\\nAetherDrive manages two types of AVs:\\\\n1.  **Standard Sedans (SS):** Primarily used for ride-hailing services. The company owns a total fleet of 100 Standard Sedans.\\\\n2.  **Cargo Vans (CV):** Primarily used for package delivery services. The company owns a total fleet of 50 Cargo Vans.\\\\n\\\\nThe metropolitan area is divided into three primary service zones:\\\\n1.  **Central Business District (CBD)**\\\\n2.  **Residential Suburbs (RES)**\\\\n3.  **Industrial Park (IND)**\\\\n\\\\nFor each week of the planning period, AetherDrive needs to decide how many of each AV type to deploy to each service zone. The objective is to maximize total net profit, which is calculated as total revenue generated from deployed AVs minus the total operating costs of these AVs over the four-week period.\\\\n\\\\nConsider the following operational details and constraints:\\\\n\\\\n**1. Vehicle Operational Capacity:**\\\\n*   Each Standard Sedan (SS) can provide up to 15 service units per week (e.g., rides).\\\\n*   Each Cargo Van (CV) can provide up to 10 service units per week (e.g., deliveries).\\\\n\\\\n**2. Fleet Availability for Deployment:**\\\\n*   Each week, 15% of the total fleet of each AV type must be taken offline for routine servicing, charging, and maintenance. These vehicles cannot be deployed for revenue-generating activities during that week. (Round up to the nearest whole vehicle for the number taken offline).\\\\n    *   For Standard Sedans: `ceil(100 * 0.15) = 15` vehicles are unavailable. So, 85 Standard Sedans are available for deployment each week.\\\\n    *   For Cargo Vans: `ceil(50 * 0.15) = 8` vehicles are unavailable. So, 42 Cargo Vans are available for deployment each week.\\\\n\\\\n**3. Minimum Strategic Deployments:**\\\\n*   To maintain market presence and ensure service reliability, AetherDrive has set minimum deployment targets for certain AV types in specific zones for each week. These targets represent the minimum number of AVs that must be deployed regardless of immediate profitability.\\\\n\\\\n| AV Type | Zone | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 |\\\\n|:--------|:-----|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|\\\\n| SS      | CBD  | 10     | 10     | 10     | 10     |\\\\n| SS      | RES  | 15     | 15     | 15     | 15     |\\\\\\n| SS      | IND  | 5      | 5      | 5      | 5      |\\\\\\n| CV      | CBD  | 5      | 5      | 5      | 5      |\\\\\\n| CV      | RES  | 8      | 8      | 8      | 8      |\\\\\\n| CV      | IND  | 10     | 10     | 10     | 10     |\\\\n\\\\n**4.

By optimizing the location of public toilets, we can better serve citizens and tourists and improve the level of urban environmental sanitation.\\n\\n    We consider a finite set of 2 potential public toilet locations, specifically Location 1 and Location 2.\\n    There are also 2 distinct demand points (areas with residents/tourists), referred to as Demand Point 1 and Demand Point 2.\\n\\n    Optimization Goals\\n    The primary goal of this optimization problem is to maximize a composite objective function that balances the benefits of serving demand, the costs of establishing facilities, and penalties for failing to meet demand.\\n    Specifically, the objective is to:\\n    Maximize: (1.0 * Usage_1 + 1.0 * Usage_2) - (50 * LocationDecision_1 + 75 * LocationDecision_2) - (20 * UnmetDemand_1 + 25 * UnmetDemand_2)\\n\\n    Where:\\n    -   `LocationDecision_i` is a binary decision variable: 1 if a public toilet is established at Location `i`, and 0 otherwise.\\n    -   `Usage_i` is a continuous variable representing the number of people served by the public toilet at Location `i`.\\n    -   `UnmetDemand_j` is a continuous variable representing the amount of demand that is not satisfied at Demand Point `j`.\\n\\n    The coefficients in the objective function represent:\\n    -   `1.0`: The \"coverage weight\" or value per unit of usage at both Location 1 and Location 2.\\n    -   `50`: The fixed cost of establishing a public toilet at Location 1.\\n    -   `75`: The fixed cost of establishing a public toilet at Location 2.\\n    -   `20`: The penalty incurred per unit of unmet demand at Demand Point 1.\\n    -   `25`: The penalty incurred per unit of unmet demand at Demand Point 2.\\n\\n    Problem Constraints\\n    1.  **Public Toilet Capacity Constraint:** Each public toilet has a maximum capacity for the number of people it can accommodate. Furthermore, a toilet can only serve people if it is actually established at that location.\\n        *   For Location 1: The number of people served, Usage_1, must be less than or equal to 100 times the binary decision variable LocationDecision_1. (Usage_1 <= 100 * LocationDecision_1)\\n        *   For Location 2: The number of people served, Usage_2, must be less than or equal to 150 times the binary decision variable LocationDecision_2. (Usage_2 <= 150 * LocationDecision_2)\\n\\n    2.  **Demand Satisfaction Constraint:** The total effective service provided by all established public toilets to a demand point, combined with any unmet demand at that point, must collectively satisfy the total demand at that point. An \"accessibility\" factor quantifies how effectively usage from a toilet location contributes to satisfying demand at a specific demand point.\\n        *   The total demand at Demand Point 1 is 50.\\n        *   The total demand at Demand Point 2 is 70.\\n\\n        The accessibility factors (Accessibility_from_i_to_j) are defined as:\\n        *   Accessibility_from_1_to_1 = 1.0\\n        *   Accessibility_from_1_to_2 = 0.8\\n        *   Accessibility_from_2_to_1 = 0.9\\n        *   Accessibility_from_2_to_2 = 1.0\\n\\n        Based on these, the demand satisfaction constraints are:\\n        *   For Demand Point 1: (1.0 * Usage_1) + (0.9 * Usage_2) + UnmetDemand_1 >= 50\\n        *   For Demand Point 2: (0.8 * Usage_1) + (1.0 * Usage_2) + UnmetDemand_2 >= 70\\n\\n    3.  **Variable Types and Non-negativity:**\\n        *   `LocationDecision_1` and `LocationDecision_2` are binary variables (can only take values 0 or 1).\\n        *   `Usage_1`, `Usage_2`, `UnmetDemand_1`, and `UnmetDemand_2` are continuous variables and must be non-negative (>= 0).\\n\\n    (Note: The original problem description included general \"Public Toilet Location Constraint\" (e.g., latitude/longitude bounds) and \"Public Toilet Distance Constraint\" (e.g., minimum distance between toilets).

The goal is to minimize the number of bins used while ensuring that all items are stored and no bin exceeds its capacity.\\n\\nHere are the details of the items and their weights:\\n- Item 0 weighs 31 units.\\n- Item 1 weighs 33 units.\\n- Item 2 weighs 34 units.\\n- Item 3 weighs 34 units.\\n- Item 4 weighs 33 units.\\n- Item 5 weighs 32 units.\\n- Item 6 weighs 34 units.\\n- Item 7 weighs 33 units.\\n\\nYou have 8 bins available (Bin 0 to Bin 7), and each bin can be either used or not used.

Through operational optimization methods, police forces, vehicles, and other resources can be effectively allocated, improving the ability to respond to crimes, reducing crime rates, and enhancing the sense of community safety.\\nIn this specific instance, we are considering two types of police resources, indexed as 0 and 1, to be allocated across two key urban areas, also indexed as 0 and 1. The allocation decision for each resource type `i` to each area `j` is represented by a binary variable `x[i,j]`, where `x[i,j] = 1` if resource type `i` is allocated to area `j`, and `x[i,j] = 0` otherwise.\\n\\nOptimization Objective\\nThe objective is to maximize the overall benefit derived from resource allocation. This benefit is calculated by considering the coverage provided by each allocated resource in each area, while simultaneously accounting for the crime rate associated with that allocation.\\nSpecifically, the objective function to be maximized is:\\nMaximize:\\n`sum_{i=0 to 1} sum_{j=0 to 1} (Coverage_Value[i][j] * x[i,j] - CrimeRate_Value[i][j] * x[i,j])`\\n\\nSubstituting the numerical values from the COPT code:\\nMaximize:\\n`(0.7 * x[0,0] - 0.5 * x[0,0]) + (0.6 * x[0,1] - 0.3 * x[0,1]) + (0.8 * x[1,0] - 0.4 * x[1,0]) + (0.5 * x[1,1] - 0.2 * x[1,1])`\\nWhich simplifies to:\\nMaximize:\\n`0.2 * x[0,0] + 0.3 * x[0,1] + 0.4 * x[1,0] + 0.3 * x[1,1]`\\n\\nProblem Constraints\\nThe allocation of resources must satisfy the following constraints:\\n\\n1.  **Resource Capacity Constraint:** The total allocation of all resource types to a specific area `j` must not exceed the capacity of that area to receive resources.\\n    *   For Area 0: `x[0,0] + x[1,0] <= 10`\\n    *   For Area 1: `x[0,1] + x[1,1] <= 15`\\n\\n2.  **Maximum Resource Allocation Constraint:** The total allocation of a specific resource type `i` across all areas must not exceed its maximum allowable allocation.\\n    *   For Resource Type 0: `x[0,0] + x[0,1] <= 8`\\n    *   For Resource Type 1: `x[1,0] + x[1,1] <= 12`\\n\\n3.  **Crime Rate Threshold Constraint:** The weighted sum of allocated resources in each area, where weights are their respective crime rate factors, must not exceed a predefined maximum crime rate threshold for that area.\\n    *   For Area 0: `0.5 * x[0,0] + 0.4 * x[1,0] <= 4`\\n    *   For Area 1: `0.3 * x[0,1] + 0.2 * x[1,1] <= 3`\\n\\n4.  **Dynamic Adjustment Constraint:** This constraint ensures a dynamic adjustment factor is applied to each allocation. Since the `DynamicFactor` values are all positive and `x[i,j]` are binary (0 or 1), this constraint effectively ensures non-negativity of the weighted allocation, which is inherently true for this problem setup.\\n    *   For Resource Type 0, Area 0: `1.2 * x[0,0] >= 0`\\n    *   For Resource Type 0, Area 1: `1.1 * x[0,1] >= 0`\\n    *   For Resource Type 1, Area 0: `1.3 * x[1,0] >= 0`\\n    *   For Resource Type 1, Area 1: `1.0 * x[1,1] >= 0`\\n\\n5.  **Minimum Resource Utilization Constraint:** Each area must receive at least a minimum level of resource utilization from the combined allocated resource types.\\n    *   For Area 0: `x[0,0] + x[1,0] >= 1`\\n    *   For Area 1: `x[0,1] + x[1,1] >= 1`\\n\\n6.  **Variable Type Constraint:** All decision variables `x[i,j]` are binary, meaning they can only take values of 0 or 1.\\n    *   `x[i,j] in {0, 1}` for `i in {0, 1}` and `j in {0, 1}`',\n",

Each item has a specific weight, and each container has a maximum capacity of 100 units. Your goal is to minimize the number of containers used while ensuring that all items are packed and that no container exceeds its capacity.\\n\\nHere are the details of the items and their weights:\\n- Item 0 weighs 33 units.\\n- Item 1 weighs 35 units.\\n- Item 2 weighs 35 units.\\n- Item 3 weighs 34 units.\\n- Item 4 weighs 33 units.\\n- Item 5 weighs 31 units.\\n- Item 6 weighs 30 units.\\n- Item 7 weighs 33 units.\\n\\nYou have eight containers available (numbered 0 through 7), and each container can hold up to 100 units of weight. However, you want to use as few containers as possible to save on shipping costs. \\n\\nTo achieve this, you must decide:\\n1. Which items to assign to which containers.\\n2. Whether to use a particular container at all (since using fewer containers is better).\\n\\nThere are two key rules you must follow:\\n1. **Capacity Rule**: The total weight of items assigned to any container cannot exceed 100 units. For example, if you assign Item 0 (33 units), Item 1 (35 units), and Item 2 (35 units) to Container 0, the total weight would be 103 units, which exceeds the limit. This is not allowed.\\n2. **Assignment Rule**: Each item must be assigned to exactly one container. No item can be left unpacked, and no item can be split across multiple containers.\\n\\nYour objective is to determine the optimal assignment of items to containers such that:\\n- The total number of containers used is minimized.\\n- All items are packed without violating the capacity or assignment rules.\\n\\nThis problem requires careful planning to balance the weights of items across containers while ensuring that no container is overloaded and that every item is accounted for. The challenge lies in finding the most efficient way to pack all eight items into the fewest possible containers without breaking any of the rules.',\n",

Each producer has a limited generation capacity, and each contract has a specific energy demand that must be met. Each contract also requires a minimum number of contributing producers to ensure reliability. The goal is to allocate energy generation across producers to meet contract demands while minimizing total production costs.\\n\\nProducer 0 can generate up to 1,370 units of energy, Producer 1 up to 1,268 units, Producer 2 up to 1,819 units, and Producer 3 up to 1,552 units.

Contracts 0, 1, 2, and 4 require at least 3 producers to contribute, while Contract 3 requires at least 2 producers.

The enterprise needs to effectively manage and optimize this supply chain to cope with risks from various aspects such as market demand fluctuations, supply interruptions, and logistics delays.\\n\\nOptimization Goals\\n1.  **Minimize the total cost of supply chain operations.** This includes:\\n    *   **Procurement costs:** A cost of **$50** for selecting Supplier 1, and **$60** for selecting Supplier 2.\\n    *   **Inventory holding costs:** A cost of **$2** per unit of inventory held at the end of Period 0, and **$2.5** per unit held at the end of Period 1.\\n    *   **Multi-modal logistics and redundancy costs:** Specific costs associated with activating logistics paths or redundancy measures. These costs are **$10** for measures related to Supplier 1 (e.g., `m[1,1]` or `m[1,2]`), and **$12** for measures related to Supplier 2 (e.g., `m[2,1]` or `m[2,2]`).\\n    *   **Risk mitigation costs:** A calculated cost of **$0.5** (derived from a base cost of **$5** multiplied by a risk factor of **0.1**) for Period 0, and **$1.2** (derived from a base cost of **$6** multiplied by a risk factor of **0.2**) for Period 1.\\n    *   The overall objective function to minimize is: `50 * x[1] + 60 * x[2] + 2 * I[0] + 2.5 * I[1] + 10 * m[1,1] + 10 * m[1,2] + 12 * m[2,1] + 12 * m[2,2] + 0.5 + 1.2`.\\n2.  **Minimize supply chain risks**, specifically by incorporating risk factors of **0.1** for Period 0 and **0.2** for Period 1 into the total cost objective.\\n3.  **Improve the robustness and flexibility of the supply chain**, and enhance the ability to respond to uncertainties and risks.\\n\\nProblem Constraints\\nThe planning considers **two potential suppliers (Supplier 1 and Supplier 2)** and **two time periods (Period 0 and Period 1)**.

Activating these measures incurs costs of **$10** if `j=1` (related to Supplier 1) and **$12** if `j=2` (related to Supplier 2).\\n-   **Risk mitigation measures constraints:** Implemented risk mitigation measures, such as standby production capacity or emergency procurement plans, contribute to the total cost.

       "{'en_question': 'There are five clients, labeled Client 0 to Client 4, each requiring two operations to be performed in sequence. Each operation takes exactly 1 unit of time to complete. The operations for each client must follow a strict sequence: the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed, with a minimum gap of 1 unit of time between them. Operations from different clients may need to be performed on the same machine, and no two operations can overlap on the same machine. To enforce this, binary decision variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. The goal is to minimize the total production time, known as the makespan, which is the time when the last operation across all clients is completed. The makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of every operation. Start times for all operations are continuous variables, and the binary variables ensure that operations on the same machine do not overlap. A large number (100,000) is used in the constraints to enforce the scheduling logic, ensuring that one operation finishes before another starts on the same machine. The problem involves determining the optimal start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines to minimize the total production time while satisfying all constraints.',\n",

       " 'generated_code': \"<thinking>\\nThe user wants to solve a scheduling problem.\\n\\n**1. Deconstruct the Problem:**\\n\\n*   **Objective:** Minimize the makespan, which is the time when the last operation is completed.\\n*   **Entities:** 5 clients, each with 2 sequential operations.\\n*   **Operations:** Each operation takes 1 unit of time.\\n*   **Constraints:**\\n    *   **Client-specific:** The second operation of a client cannot start until the first is completed, with a minimum gap of 1 unit of time. This means the start time of the second operation must be at least the end time of the first operation plus 1.\\n    *   **Machine-specific:** Operations from different clients may be on the same machine. No two operations can overlap on the same machine.\\n    *   **Variable types:** Continuous variables for start times, binary variables to determine the order of operations on shared machines.\\n    *   **Large constant:** A value of 100,000 is used in constraints to enforce the scheduling logic.\\n\\n**2. Identify Key Components for the Mathematical Model:**\\n\\n*   **Decision Variables:**\\n    *   `s_i`: The start time of the `i`-th operation.\\n    *   `x_ij`: A binary variable that is 1 if operation `i` is scheduled before operation `j` on the same machine, and 0 otherwise. This is necessary to model the non-overlapping constraint on shared machines.\\n\\n*   **Objective Function:**\\n    *   The goal is to minimize the makespan. The makespan is the maximum end time of all operations. The end time of an operation `i` is its start time `s_i` plus its duration (1 unit). So, the objective is to minimize `max(s_i + 1)` for all operations `i`.\\n\\n*   **Constraints:**\\n    1.  **Client Sequence Constraint:** For each client `c` (from 0 to 4), the start time of the second operation (`s_{c,1}`) must be greater than or equal to the end time of the first operation (`s_{c,0} + 1`) plus the minimum gap of 1. This gives `s_{c,1} >= s_{c,0} + 1 + 1` or `s_{c,1} >= s_{c,0} + 2`.\\n    2.  **Machine Non-overlap Constraint:** For any two operations `i` and `j` on the same machine, they cannot overlap. This is modeled using the binary variables `x_ij`. The constraint is: `s_i + 1 <= s_j + M * (1 - x_ij)` and `s_j + 1 <= s_i + M * x_ij`. Here, `M` is a large constant (100,000). These constraints ensure that if `x_ij` is 1 (operation `i` is before `j`), then `s_i + 1 <= s_j`, and if `x_ij` is 0 (operation `j` is before `i`), then `s_j + 1 <= s_i`. This effectively enforces that one operation must finish before the other can start.\\n    3.  **Makespan Definition:** The makespan `C_max` must be greater than or equal to the end time of every operation. This is modeled by `C_max >= s_i + 1` for all operations `i`.\\n    4.  **Variable Bounds:** The start times `s_i` are continuous and non-negative. The binary variables `x_ij` are 0 or 1.\\n\\n**3. Plan the COPT Implementation:**\\n\\n*   **Data Structures:**\\n    *   A list of clients, each with a list of their two operations.\\n    *   A list of all operations, indexed by a single identifier (e.g., `op_id`).\\n    *   A list of all machines, which will be determined based on the operations' machine assignments.\\n\\n*   **Model Creation:**\\n    *   Create a COPT environment and model.\\n    *   Add continuous variables for the start times of all operations (`s_i`).\\n    *   Add binary variables for the pairwise ordering constraints (`x_ij`).\\n    *   Add a continuous variable for the makespan (`C_max`).\\n\\n*   **Constraint Addition:**\\n    *   Add the client sequence constraints using a loop over the clients.\\n    *   Add the machine non-overlap constraints using nested loops over all pairs of operations.\\n    *   Add the makespan definition constraints using a loop over all operations.\\n\\n*   **Objective Function:**\\n    *   Set the objective to minimize the makespan variable `C_max`.\\n\\n*   **Solve and Output:**\\n    *   Solve the model.\\n    *   Print the optimal objective value as requested.\\n\\nThis structured approach ensures all aspects of the problem are accurately translated into a mathematical model and then into COPT code.\\n</thinking>\\n<model>\\n### Mathematical Model Formulation\\n\\n**Sets and Indices**\\n*   `C = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`: The set of clients.\\n*   `O = {0, 1, ..., 9}`: The set of all operations, indexed by `i`.\\n*   `M`: The set of machines. The exact definition of `M` is not provided, so it is assumed to be a set of machines that can be used for any operation. The model will implicitly define the machine assignments based on the constraints.\\n\\n**Parameters**\\n*   `d_i = 1`: The duration of each operation `i`.\\n*   `gap = 1`: The minimum gap required between the two operations of a single client.\\n*   `M = 100,000`: A large constant used to enforce the non-overlap constraints.\\n\\n**Decision Variables**\\n*   `s_i`: A continuous variable representing the start time of operation `i`.\\n*   `C_max`: A continuous variable representing the makespan (total production time).\\n*   `x_ij`: A binary variable for each pair of operations `i, j \\\\in O` where `i \\\\ne j`. `x_ij = 1` if operation `i` is scheduled before operation `j` on the same machine, and `x_ij = 0` otherwise.\\n\\n**Objective Function**\\nThe objective is to minimize the makespan.\\n```\\nMinimize C_max\\n```\\n\\n**Constraints**\\n\\n1.  **Client Sequence Constraint:** For each client `c \\\\in C`, the second operation must start after the first operation is completed, with a minimum gap of 1 unit of time.\\n    ```\\n    s_{2c} >= s_{2c-1} + d_{2c-1} + gap\\n    ```\\n    This can be written for each client `c` as:\\n    ```\\n    s_{c,1} >= s_{c,0} + 1 + 1\\n    s_{c,1} >= s_{c,0} + 2\\n    ```\\n\\n2.  **Machine Non-overlap Constraint:** For any two operations `i` and `j` on the same machine, they cannot overlap. This is modeled using the binary variables `x_ij`.\\n    ```\\n    s_i + d_i <= s_j + M * (1 - x_ij)\\n    s_j + d_j <= s_i + M * x_ij\\n    ```\\n    These constraints ensure that if `x_ij = 1`, then `s_i + d_i <= s_j`, and if `x_ij = 0`, then `s_j + d_j <= s_i`. This enforces that one operation must finish before the other can start.\\n\\n3.  **Makespan Definition:** The makespan must be greater than or equal to the completion time of every operation.\\n    ```\\n    C_max >= s_i + d_i,  for all i \\\\in O\\n    ```\\n\\n4.  **Variable Bounds:**\\n    *   `s_i >= 0` for all `i \\\\in O`.\\n    *   `x_ij \\\\in {0, 1}` for all `i, j \\\\in O` where `i \\\\ne j`.\\n</model>\\n<code>\\nimport coptpy as cp\\nfrom coptpy import COPT\\n\\n# Data\\nn_clients = 5\\nn_ops_per_client = 2\\nn_ops = n_clients * n_ops_per_client\\nn_machines = 5  # Assuming 5 machines for this example\\n\\n# Parameters\\nop_duration = 1\\nmin_gap = 1\\nM = 100000\\n\\n# Create COPT environment and model\\nenv = cp.Envr()\\nmodel = env.createModel()\\n\\n# Decision variables\\n# s_i: start time of operation i\\ns = model.addVars(n_ops, vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, lb=0)\\n# C_max: makespan\\nC_max = model.addVar(vtype=COPT.CONTINUOUS, lb=0)\\n# x_ij: binary variable for ordering on the same machine\\nx = model.addVars(n_ops, n_ops, vtype=COPT.BINARY)\\n\\n# Objective function: Minimize makespan\\nmodel.setObjective(C_max, COPT.MINIMIZE)\\n\\n# Constraints\\n# 1.
