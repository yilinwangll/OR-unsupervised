       " 'en_math_model_coptpy_code': \"<thinking>\\nThe user wants to solve a multi-objective optimization problem for an event planning company.\\n\\n**1. Identify Decision Variables:**\\n- Let `x` be the number of Speakers to hire.\\n- Let `y` be the number of Coordinators to hire.\\n- Since we cannot hire a fraction of a person, `x` and `y` must be integer variables.\\n\\n**2. Identify and Formulate Objectives:**\\nThe problem has three distinct objectives:\\n- **Objective 1: Minimize Total Cost.**\\n  - Cost per Speaker: $500\\n  - Cost per Coordinator: $350\\n  - Total Cost function: `C(x, y) = 500x + 350y`\\n- **Objective 2: Minimize Environmental Impact.**\\n  - CO2 per Speaker: 150 kg\\n  - CO2 per Coordinator: 100 kg\\n  - Total CO2 function: `E(x, y) = 150x + 100y`\\n- **Objective 3: Maximize Total Number of Professionals.**\\n  - Total Professionals function: `P(x, y) = x + y`\\n\\n**3. Combine Objectives into a Single Objective Function:**\\nThis is a multi-objective problem. A common method to solve such problems with a single model is to create a weighted sum of the individual objective functions. The problem statement does not provide weights, which implies they might be considered equally important. I will proceed with this assumption (i.e., all weights are 1).\\n\\nTo combine them, all objectives must be in the same direction (either all minimization or all maximization).\\n- Minimize `C(x, y) = 500x + 350y`\\n- Minimize `E(x, y) = 150x + 100y`\\n- Maximize `P(x, y) = x + y`, which is equivalent to Minimizing `-P(x, y) = -(x + y)`.\\n\\nThe combined objective function `Z` to be minimized is the sum of these:\\n`Z = (500x + 350y) + (150x + 100y) - (x + y)`\\n`Z = (500 + 150 - 1)x + (350 + 100 - 1)y`\\n`Z = 649x + 449y`\\n\\n**4. Identify and Formulate Constraints:**\\n- **Constraint 1: Workshop Requirement.** At least 50 workshops must be handled.\\n  - `3x + 2y >= 50`\\n- **Constraint 2: Budget Limit.** Total cost cannot exceed $10,000.\\n  - `500x + 350y <= 10000`\\n- **Constraint 3: Speaker-Coordinator Ratio 1.** Speakers cannot exceed twice the number of Coordinators.\\n  - `x <= 2y` which can be rewritten as `x - 2y <= 0`\\n- **Constraint 4: Speaker-Coordinator Ratio 2.** Coordinators cannot exceed twice the number of Speakers.\\n  - `y <= 2x` which can be rewritten as `-2x + y <= 0`\\n- **Constraint 5: Speaker Availability.** Maximum of 15 Speakers.\\n  - `x <= 15`\\n- **Constraint 6: Coordinator Availability.** Maximum of 25 Coordinators.\\n  - `y <= 25`\\n- **Variable Type Constraints:** The number of professionals must be non-negative integers.\\n  - `x >= 0`, `y >= 0`\\n  - `x, y` are integers.\\n\\n**5. Final Mathematical Model Summary:**\\nThe problem is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP).\\n\\n- **Decision Variables:**\\n  - `x`: Number of Speakers (Integer, >= 0)\\n  - `y`: Number of Coordinators (Integer, >= 0)\\n\\n- **Objective Function:**\\n  - `Minimize 649x + 449y`\\n\\n- **Constraints:**\\n  1. `3x + 2y >= 50`\\n  2. `500x + 350y <= 10000`\\n  3. `x - 2y <= 0`\\n  4. `-2x + y <= 0`\\n  5. `x <= 15`\\n  6. `y <= 25`\\n\\nThis model is now ready to be translated into COPT Python code.\\n</thinking>\\n<model>\\n### Decision Variables\\nLet $x$ be the number of Speakers hired.\\nLet $y$ be the number of Coordinators hired.\\n$x, y$ are non-negative integers.\\n\\n### Objective Functions\\nThe problem has three objectives:\\n1.  **Minimize Total Cost:** $C = 500x + 350y$\\n2.  **Minimize Environmental Impact:** $E = 150x + 100y$\\n3.  **Maximize Total Professionals:** $P = x + y$\\n\\nTo solve this as a single-objective problem, we create a composite objective function by summing the individual objectives. We assume equal weights for each objective. The maximization objective is converted to minimization by negating it.\\n\\n**Combined Objective Function:**\\nMinimize $Z = (500x + 350y) + (150x + 100y) - (x + y)$\\nSimplifying this, we get:\\nMinimize $Z = 649x + 449y$\\n\\n### Constraints\\n1.  **Workshop Requirement:** The total number of workshops handled must be at least 50.\\n    $3x + 2y \\\\ge 50$\\n\\n2.  **Budget Constraint:** The total daily cost cannot exceed $10,000.\\n    $500x + 350y \\\\le 10000$\\n\\n3.  **Ratio Constraint 1:** The number of Speakers cannot exceed twice the number of Coordinators.\\n    $x \\\\le 2y \\\\implies x - 2y \\\\le 0$\\n\\n4.  **Ratio Constraint 2:** The number of Coordinators cannot exceed twice the number of Speakers.\\n    $y \\\\le 2x \\\\implies -2x + y \\\\le 0$\\n\\n5.  **Resource Availability:** There are limits on the number of available professionals.\\n    $x \\\\le 15$\\n    $y \\\\le 25$\\n\\n6.  **Non-negativity and Integrality:** The number of professionals must be non-negative integers.\\n    $x \\\\ge 0, y \\\\ge 0$\\n    $x, y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$\\n</model>\\n<code>\\nimport coptpy as cp\\nfrom coptpy import COPT\\n\\n# Create COPT environment and model\\nenv = cp.Envr()\\nmodel = env.createModel()\\n\\n# Define decision variables\\n# x: number of Speakers\\n# y: number of Coordinators\\nx = model.addVar(lb=0, ub=15, vtype=COPT.INTEGER)\\ny = model.addVar(lb=0, ub=25, vtype=COPT.INTEGER)\\n\\n# Set the objective function\\n# Minimize Z = 649x + 449y\\nmodel.setObjective(649 * x + 449 * y, COPT.MINIMIZE)\\n\\n# Add constraints\\n# 1.
