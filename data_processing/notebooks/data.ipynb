According to contract bookings, the weekly demand for these two foods will rise sharply, as shown in Table 1-11. Therefore, the factory has decided to train 50 new workers by the end of the 8th week. It is known that a worker works $40 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{h}$ per week, and a skilled worker can train up to three new workers in two weeks (during the training period, both the skilled worker and the trainees do not participate in production). The weekly wage of a skilled worker is 360 yuan, the weekly wage of a trainee during the training period is 120 yuan, and after training, the wage is 240 yuan per week, with the same production efficiency as skilled workers. During the transition period of training, many skilled workers are willing to work overtime, and the factory has decided to arrange some workers to work $60 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{h}$ per week, with a weekly wage of 540 yuan. If the booked food cannot be delivered on time, the compensation fee for each week of delay per $ \\\\ \\\\mathrm{kg}$ is 0.5 yuan for food I and 0.6 yuan for food II.

The factory has 50 skilled workers initially, and by the end of the 8th week, it will have trained 50 new workers. Workers can work 40 hours per week normally, but some can work overtime (60 hours per week) with higher wages. Skilled workers can train up to three new workers in two weeks, but during training, both the skilled worker and trainees are not available for production. The wages are: skilled worker 360 yuan/week, trainee during training 120 yuan/week, and after training 240 yuan/week. The production rates are: skilled worker produces 10 kg/h for food I or 6 kg/h for food II. The demand for each week is given in Table 1-11. If food cannot be delivered on time, there is a compensation fee: 0.5 yuan/kg/week for food I and 0.6 yuan/kg/week for food II. The goal is to minimize total cost, which includes wages and compensation for delays.\\n\\nKey points:\\n1. There are 8 weeks of production.\\n2. Initially, 50 skilled workers.\\n3. By week 8, 50 new workers will be trained.\\n4. Training takes 2 weeks, so during training, the skilled worker is not available for production.\\n5. A skilled worker can train up to 3 new workers in 2 weeks.\\n6. Workers can work 40 hours/week normally or 60 hours/week with overtime.\\n7. Wages: skilled worker 360 yuan/week, trainee during training 120 yuan/week, after training 240 yuan/week.\\n8. Production rates: 10 kg/h for food I, 6 kg/h for food II.\\n9. Demand for each week is given in Table 1-11.\\n10. Compensation for delay: 0.5 yuan/kg/week for food I, 0.6 yuan/kg/week for food II.\\n11. The factory wants to minimize total cost (wages + compensation).\\n\\nWe need to decide:\\n- How many workers to assign to each type of work (food I or food II) each week.\\n- How many workers to train each week.\\n- Whether to use overtime for some workers.\\n- How to allocate workers to different tasks (production or training).\\n\\nThis is a complex scheduling and resource allocation problem. We need to model the availability of workers over time, considering training periods and overtime. The model should track:\\n- Skilled workers available for production each week.\\n- Trainees available for production after training.\\n- Workers working overtime.\\n- Production output for each food type each week.\\n- Inventory or backlog of food to meet demand.\\n- Compensation for delays.\\n\\nThe objective is to minimize total cost, which includes:\\n1. Wages for all workers (skilled, trainees, overtime workers).\\n2. Compensation for any food that is not delivered on time.\\n\\nWe need to decide:\\n- For each week, how many workers to assign to produce food I and food II.\\n- How many workers to train each week.\\n- Whether to use overtime for some workers.\\n\\nThe model should also track:\\n- The number of skilled workers available each week.\\n- The number of trainees available each week.\\n- The number of workers working overtime each week.\\n- The production output for each food type each week.\\n- The demand for each food type each week.\\n- The inventory of food at the end of each week (to determine if there is a delay).\\n\\nThis is a dynamic programming problem with state variables representing the number of workers available each week. However, given the complexity, we can formulate it as a linear programming problem with decision variables for each week and each type of worker.\\n\\nLet's define:\\n- Let \\\\( x_{i,t} \\\\) = number of workers assigned to produce food I in week t.\\n- Let \\\\( y_{i,t} \\\\) = number of workers assigned to produce food II in week t.\\n- Let \\\\( z_t \\\\) = number of workers trained in week t.\\n- Let \\\\( w_t \\\\) = number of workers working overtime in week t.\\n\\nWe need to track the number of skilled workers available each week. Initially, there are 50 skilled workers. Each week, some workers may be training (and thus not available for production). Also, trainees become skilled workers after training.\\n\\nLet's define:\\n- \\\\( S_t \\\\) = number of skilled workers available for production in week t.\\n- \\\\( T_t \\\\) = number of trainees available for production in week t.\\n\\nInitially, \\\\( S_1 = 50 \\\\), \\\\( T_1 = 0 \\\\).\\n\\nFor each week t, the number of skilled workers available for production is:\\n- Skilled workers not training and not working overtime.\\n- Trainees who have completed training and are now skilled workers.\\n\\nThe training process: A skilled worker can train up to 3 new workers in 2 weeks. So if we train z_t workers in week t, they will be available for production starting in week t+2 (after completing training). But during training (weeks t and t+1), the skilled worker is not available for production.\\n\\nAlso, workers can work overtime (60 hours/week) with higher wage.\\n\\nThe production output for food I in week t is:\\n- Each worker assigned to food I produces 10 kg/h for 40 hours or 60 hours (if overtime).\\n- So if a worker works 40 hours, they produce 400 kg (10 kg/h * 40 h).\\n- If a worker works 60 hours, they produce 600 kg (10 kg/h * 60 h).\\n\\nSimilarly for food II: 6 kg/h * 40 h = 240 kg, or 6 kg/h * 60 h = 360 kg.\\n\\nThe demand for food I in week t is given in Table 1-11.\\nThe demand for food II in week t is given in Table 1-11.\\n\\nWe need to meet demand or face compensation. The compensation is 0.5 yuan/kg/week for food I and 0.6 yuan/kg/week for food II for each week of delay.\\n\\nThe total cost includes:\\n1. Wages for all workers.\\n2. Compensation for any food not delivered on time.\\n\\nWe need to decide how much food to produce each week to meet demand or carry over inventory.\\n\\nThis is a complex problem that requires tracking inventory over time. We can model it as a linear programming problem with decision variables for production, training, and overtime, and constraints to ensure demand is met or compensated.\\n\\nLet's define:\\n- \\\\( P_{I,t} \\\\) = production of food I in week t.\\n- \\\\( P_{II,t} \\\\) = production of food II in week t.\\n- \\\\( D_{I,t} \\\\) = demand for food I in week t.\\n- \\\\( D_{II,t} \\\\) = demand for food II in week t.\\n- \\\\( C_{I,t} \\\\) = compensation for food I in week t.\\n- \\\\( C_{II,t} \\\\) = compensation for food II in week t.\\n\\nWe need to ensure that the total food available (production + inventory from previous weeks) meets demand or we pay compensation.\\n\\nLet's define:\\n- \\\\( I_{I,t} \\\\) = inventory of food I at the end of week t.\\n- \\\\( I_{II,t} \\\\) = inventory of food II at the end of week t.\\n\\nInitially, \\\\( I_{I,0} = 0 \\\\), \\\\( I_{II,0} = 0 \\\\).\\n\\nFor each week t:\\n- Production of food I: \\\\( P_{I,t} \\\\)\\n- Production of food II: \\\\( P_{II,t} \\\\)\\n- Demand for food I: \\\\( D_{I,t} \\\\)\\n- Demand for food II: \\\\( D_{II,t} \\\\)\\n- Inventory at the end of week t: \\\\( I_{I,t} = I_{I,t-1} + P_{I,t} - D_{I,t} \\\\)\\n- Similarly for food II.\\n\\nIf production is less than demand, we pay compensation for the shortfall.\\n\\nThe compensation for food I in week t is: \\\\( C_{I,t} = \\\\max(0, D_{I,t} - P_{I,t} - I_{I,t-1}) \\\\times 0.5 \\\\)\\nThe compensation for food II in week t is: \\\\( C_{II,t} = \\\\max(0, D_{II,t} - P_{II,t} - I_{II,t-1}) \\\\times 0.6 \\\\)\\n\\nThe total cost is the sum of wages and compensation.\\n\\nThe wages depend on the number of workers assigned to production and whether they work overtime.\\n\\nLet's define:\\n- For each week t, the number of workers assigned to food I: \\\\( x_{I,t} \\\\)\\n- For each week t, the number of workers assigned to food II: \\\\( x_{II,t} \\\\)\\n- For each week t, the number of workers working overtime: \\\\( w_t \\\\)\\n\\nThe total hours worked by workers in week t is: \\\\( 40 \\\\times (x_{I,t} + x_{II,t}) + 60 \\\\times w_t \\\\)\\n\\nThe production output for food I in week t is: \\\\( P_{I,t} = 10 \\\\times (40 \\\\times x_{I,t} + 60 \\\\times w_{I,t}) \\\\) where \\\\( w_{I,t} \\\\) is the number of overtime workers assigned to food I.\\nSimilarly for food II: \\\\( P_{II,t} = 6 \\\\times (40 \\\\times x_{II,t} + 60 \\\\times w_{II,t}) \\\\) where \\\\( w_{II,t} \\\\) is the number of overtime workers assigned to food II.\\n\\nBut we need to decide how many workers to assign to overtime. Alternatively, we can decide how many workers to assign to production and whether they work overtime.\\n\\nActually, the overtime decision is separate: some workers can work 60 hours/week instead of 40 hours/week. So for each worker assigned to production, we can choose whether they work 40 or 60 hours.\\n\\nLet's define:\\n- For each week t, the number of workers assigned to food I: \\\\( x_{I,t} \\\\)\\n- For each week t, the number of workers assigned to food II: \\\\( x_{II,t} \\\\)\\n- For each week t, the number of workers working overtime: \\\\( w_t \\\\)\\n\\nThe total hours worked by workers in week t is: \\\\( 40 \\\\times (x_{I,t} + x_{II,t}) + 60 \\\\times w_t \\\\)\\n\\nThe production output for food I in week t is: \\\\( P_{I,t} = 10 \\\\times (40 \\\\times x_{I,t} + 60 \\\\times w_{I,t}) \\\\) where \\\\( w_{I,t} \\\\) is the number of overtime workers assigned to food I.\\nSimilarly for food II: \\\\( P_{II,t} = 6 \\\\times (40 \\\\times x_{II,t} + 60 \\\\times w_{II,t}) \\\\) where \\\\( w_{II,t} \\\\) is the number of overtime workers assigned to food II.\\n\\nBut we need to ensure that the total number of workers working overtime does not exceed the total number of workers available.\\n\\nThe total number of workers available for production in week t is: \\\\( S_t + T_t \\\\) where \\\\( S_t \\\\) is the number of skilled workers available and \\\\( T_t \\\\) is the number of trainees available.\\n\\nThe number of trainees available in week t is the number of trainees who have completed training by week t. Trainees start training in week t and become available for production in week t+2.\\n\\nThe number of skilled workers available in week t is the initial 50 minus those who are training in week t and t+1.\\n\\nThe training process: If we train z_t workers in week t, they will be available for production starting in week t+2. But during training (weeks t and t+1), the skilled worker is not available for production.\\n\\nSo the number of skilled workers available in week t is:\\n- Initial 50 minus those who are training in week t and t+1.\\n\\nLet's define:\\n- \\\\( S_t \\\\) = number of skilled workers available for production in week t.\\n- \\\\( T_t \\\\) = number of trainees available for production in week t.\\n\\nInitially, \\\\( S_1 = 50 \\\\), \\\\( T_1 = 0 \\\\).\\n\\nFor each week t:\\n- The number of skilled workers available is: \\\\( S_t = 50 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} z_i \\\\) if t <= 8, but we need to account for training periods.\\nActually, the training takes 2 weeks, so if we train z_t workers in week t, they will be available for production starting in week t+2. But during training (weeks t and t+1), the skilled worker is not available for production.\\n\\nSo the number of skilled workers available in week t is:\\n- The initial 50 minus the number of workers who are training in week t and t+1.\\n\\nLet's define:\\n- For each week t, the number of workers training in week t: \\\\( z_t \\\\)\\n- The number of workers training in week t will be available for production starting in week t+2.\\n\\nSo the number of skilled workers available in week t is:\\n- If t <= 8, then \\\\( S_t = 50 -

Workers can produce food I at 10 kg/h or food II at 6 kg/h. The demand for these foods increases weekly as shown in Table 1-11. The factory needs to train 50 new workers by the end of the 8th week. Training takes 2 weeks, and a skilled worker can train up to 3 new workers during that time. During training, both the trainer and trainees do not participate in production. \\n\\nKey points:\\n1. Workers work 40 hours per week normally. Skilled workers earn 360 yuan/week.\\n2. Trainees during training earn 120 yuan/week, and after training (becoming skilled) earn 240 yuan/week.\\n3. Some workers can work overtime (60 hours/week) at 540 yuan/week.\\n4. There\\'s a penalty for not meeting demand: 0.5 yuan/kg/week for food I, 0.6 yuan/kg/week for food II.\\n5. We need to minimize total cost (wages + penalties).\\n\\nWe need to decide:\\n- How many workers to train each week.\\n- Which workers to assign to overtime.\\n- How to allocate production hours to meet demand.\\n\\nWe\\'ll model this as an optimization problem. Let\\'s define:\\n- Let W_t = number of skilled workers at week t.\\n- Let T_t = number of trainees at week t (during training).\\n- Let O_t = number of workers working overtime at week t.\\n- Let P_I_t = kg of food I produced at week t.\\n- Let P_II_t = kg of food II produced at week t.\\n\\nWe need to consider the training process: training takes 2 weeks, so a worker trained in week t becomes skilled in week t+2. Also, during training, the trainer and trainee are not producing.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. Initial skilled workers: W_1 = 50.\\n2. Workers can train up to 3 new workers per week. So for each week t, the number of trainees that can be trained is limited by the number of skilled workers available to train.\\n3. For each week t, the number of trainees that can be trained is at most 3 * (number of skilled workers at week t).\\n4. After training, trainees become skilled workers. So W_{t+2} += T_t.\\n5. Total workers available for production at week t: W_t + T_t (trainees not yet trained) + O_t (overtime workers). But trainees not yet trained are still working? Actually, during training, trainees are not producing. So only skilled workers and overtime workers produce.\\n\\nWait, the problem says: \"during the training period, both the skilled worker and the trainees do not participate in production.\" So during training, the trainer is also not producing. So if a worker is training, they are not producing, and neither are the trainees. So production is only from skilled workers not training and overtime workers.\\n\\nWe need to track:\\n- Skilled workers: W_t.\\n- Trainees: T_t.\\n- Overtime workers: O_t.\\n\\nProduction capacity: Each skilled worker can work 40 hours/week at 10 kg/h for food I or 6 kg/h for food II. Overtime workers work 60 hours/week at the same rates.\\n\\nLet\\'s define:\\n- For each week t, we can assign workers to produce food I or food II.\\n- Let x_I_t = hours of skilled workers producing food I at week t.\\n- Let x_II_t = hours of skilled workers producing food II at week t.\\n- Let y_I_t = hours of overtime workers producing food I at week t.\\n- Let y_II_t = hours of overtime workers producing food II at week t.\\n\\nThen:\\nP_I_t = 10 * (x_I_t + y_I_t) (since food I requires 10 kg/h per worker).\\nP_II_t = 6 * (x_II_t + y_II_t) (since food II requires 6 kg/h per worker).\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. Total hours available for skilled workers at week t: W_t * 40 hours.\\n2. Total hours available for overtime workers at week t: O_t * 60 hours.\\n3. The sum of hours producing food I and food II cannot exceed available hours.\\n4. For each week t, the number of trainees trained is at most 3 * (number of skilled workers available to train at that week).\\n5. After training, trainees become skilled workers in week t+2.\\n6. The total workers available for training at week t is W_t (skilled workers).\\n7. We need to meet demand: P_I_t >= D_I_t, P_II_t >= D_II_t, where D_I_t and D_II_t are the demand values from Table 1-11.\\n8. If we don\\'t meet demand, we incur penalty: 0.5 * (D_I_t - P_I_t) for food I, 0.6 * (D_II_t - P_II_t) for food II if P_I_t < D_I_t or P_II_t < D_II_t.\\n9. We need to decide how many workers to train each week, which workers to assign to overtime, and how to allocate hours.\\n\\nThis is a complex problem with time-dependent variables and penalties. We\\'ll need to model it as a linear programming problem with time periods.\\n\\nLet\\'s define decision variables:\\n- For each week t (1 to 8):\\n  - w_t: number of skilled workers at week t.\\n  - t_t: number of trainees at week t (during training).\\n  - o_t: number of overtime workers at week t.\\n  - x_I_t: hours of skilled workers producing food I at week t.\\n  - x_II_t: hours of skilled workers producing food II at week t.\\n  - y_I_t: hours of overtime workers producing food I at week t.\\n  - y_II_t: hours of overtime workers producing food II at week t.\\n\\nObjective: Minimize total cost = wage cost + penalty cost.\\n\\nWage cost = sum over t of (w_t * 360) + sum over t of (t_t * 120) + sum over t of (o_t * 540).\\nPenalty cost = sum over t of max(0, 0.5 * (D_I_t - P_I_t)) + sum over t of max(0, 0.6 * (D_II_t - P_II_t)).\\n\\nBut wait, the overtime workers earn 540 yuan/week regardless of whether they produce food I or II. So we need to track which workers are working overtime.\\n\\nActually, the overtime workers are a subset of the workers. So we need to decide how many workers to assign to overtime each week.\\n\\nWe need to model the number of workers available for production at each week. That depends on:\\n- Skilled workers (w_t).\\n- Trainees (t_t) are not producing during training.\\n- Overtime workers (o_t) are working extra hours.\\n\\nBut workers can be both skilled and overtime? Or are overtime workers separate from skilled workers?\\n\\nThe problem says: \"a worker works 40 hours per week, and a skilled worker can train up to three new workers in two weeks (during the training period, both the skilled worker and the trainees do not participate in production). The weekly wage of a skilled worker is 360 yuan, the weekly wage of a trainee during the training period is 120 yuan, and after training, the wage is 240 yuan per week, with the same production efficiency as skilled workers. During the transition period of training, many skilled workers are willing to work overtime, and the factory has decided to arrange some workers to work 60 hours per week, with a weekly wage of 540 yuan.\"\\n\\nSo overtime workers are additional workers who work 60 hours per week at 540 yuan. They are separate from skilled workers and trainees.\\n\\nSo total workers available for production at week t = skilled workers (w_t) + overtime workers (o_t). But skilled workers can be assigned to overtime? Actually, the problem says: \"During the transition period of training, many skilled workers are willing to work overtime, and the factory has decided to arrange some workers to work 60 hours per week, with a weekly wage of 540 yuan.\" So skilled workers can be assigned to work overtime. So the same worker can be both skilled and working overtime.\\n\\nSo we need to model:\\n- For each week t, each worker can be:\\n  - Skilled and working 40 hours (normal).\\n  - Skilled and working 60 hours (overtime).\\n  - Trainee (not producing, only during training).\\n  - Not working (but this is not considered since we want to meet demand).\\n\\nActually, the overtime is an additional option for skilled workers. So the same skilled worker can work overtime or not. So we need to decide for each worker whether they work overtime or not.\\n\\nBut since we have a large number of workers, we\\'ll need to aggregate.\\n\\nLet\\'s define:\\n- For each week t, let h_I_t = hours of skilled workers producing food I at week t.\\n- Let h_II_t = hours of skilled workers producing food II at week t.\\n- Let o_I_t = hours of overtime workers producing food I at week t.\\n- Let o_II_t = hours of overtime workers producing food II at week t.\\n\\nThen:\\nP_I_t = 10 * (h_I_t + o_I_t)\\nP_II_t = 6 * (h_II_t + o_II_t)\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. Total hours available for skilled workers at week t: W_t * 40 hours.\\n2. Total hours available for overtime workers at week t: O_t * 60 hours.\\n3. For skilled workers, the sum of hours producing food I and food II cannot exceed 40 hours per worker.\\n4. For overtime workers, the sum of hours producing food I and food II cannot exceed 60 hours per worker.\\n5. The number of overtime workers O_t is a decision variable.\\n6.

Initial condition: \\\\( w_1 = 50 \\\\).\\n2. Training propagation: For each week \\\\( t \\\\), the trainees from week \\\\( t \\\\) become skilled workers in week \\\\( t+2 \\\\). Thus:\\n   \\\\( w_{t+2} = w_{t+2}^{\\\\text{initial}} + t_t \\\\) for \\\\( t = 1, 2, ..., 8 \\\\),\\n   where \\\\( w_{t+2}^{\\\\text{initial}} \\\\) is the number of skilled workers at week \\\\( t+2 \\\\) before adding new trainees. Since we\\'re building the model sequentially, we can write:\\n   \\\\( w_{t+2} = w_{t+2}^{\\\\text{initial}} + t_t \\\\), but since \\\\( w_{t+2}^{\\\\text{initial}} \\\\) is already part of the model, we need to ensure that the trainees from previous weeks are added. Actually, for each week \\\\( t \\\\), the trainees from week \\\\( t \\\\) contribute to the skilled workers in week \\\\( t+2 \\\\). So we can write:\\n   \\\\( w_{t+2} = w_{t+2}^{\\\\text{initial}} + t_t \\\\) for \\\\( t = 1, 2, ..., 6 \\\\) (since \\\\( t+2 \\\\leq 8 \\\\) when \\\\( t \\\\leq 6 \\\\)).\\n3. Training capacity: For each week \\\\( t \\\\), the number of trainees trained is at most 3 times the number of skilled workers available to train:\\n   \\\\( t_t \\\\leq 3 \\\\cdot w_t \\\\).\\n4. Skilled worker hours: For each week \\\\( t \\\\), the total hours producing food I and II cannot exceed the available hours (40 hours per skilled worker):\\n   \\\\( h_I_t + h_II_t \\\\leq 40 \\\\cdot w_t \\\\).\\n5. Overtime worker hours: For each week \\\\( t \\\\), the total hours producing food I and II cannot exceed the available hours (60 hours per overtime worker):\\n   \\\\( o_I_t + o_II_t \\\\leq 60 \\\\cdot o_t \\\\).\\n6. Demand satisfaction: For each week \\\\( t \\\\), production must meet demand or incur penalty:\\n   \\\\( P_I_t \\\\geq D_I_t \\\\) (no penalty if met).\\n   \\\\( P_II_t \\\\geq D_II_t \\\\) (no penalty if met).\\n   But penalty cost is non-linear due to max(0, ...). To linearize, we can introduce slack variables for underproduction.\\n   Let \\\\( s_I_t = \\\\max(0, D_I_t - P_I_t) \\\\), \\\\( s_II_t = \\\\max(0, D_II_t - P_II_t) \\\\).\\n   Then:\\n   \\\\( s_I_t \\\\geq D_I_t - P_I_t \\\\)\\n   \\\\( s_I_t \\\\geq 0 \\\\)\\n   Similarly for \\\\( s_II_t \\\\).\\n   Then penalty cost = \\\\( 0.5 \\\\cdot s_I_t + 0.6 \\\\cdot s_II_t \\\\).\\n7. Production formulas: \\\\( P_I_t = 10 \\\\cdot (h_I_t + o_I_t) \\\\), \\\\( P_II_t = 6 \\\\cdot (h_II_t + o_II_t) \\\\).\\n8. Non-negativity and integrality: All variables are non-negative. \\\\( w_t, t_t, o_t \\\\) are integers; \\\\( h_I_t, h_II_t, o_I_t, o_II_t, s_I_t, s_II_t \\\\) are continuous.\\n\\nNote: The model is linear once we introduce the slack variables for penalties.

       " 'en_math_model_coptpy_code': 'assistant\\n<thinking>\\nLet\\'s break down the problem step by step.\\n\\nWe have a beverage factory that needs to produce a beverage over 4 weeks to meet weekly demand. The goal is to minimize total cost, which includes both production cost and storage cost for any surplus.\\n\\nKey information from the table:\\n- Week 1: Demand = 15,000 boxes, Production Capacity = 30,000 boxes, Cost = 5.0 (per 1000 boxes)\\n- Week 2: Demand = 25,000 boxes, Production Capacity = 40,000 boxes, Cost = 5.1\\n- Week 3: Demand = 35,000 boxes, Production Capacity = 45,000 boxes, Cost = 5.4\\n- Week 4: Demand = 25,000 boxes, Production Capacity = 20,000 boxes, Cost = 5.5\\n\\nNote: All values are in thousands of boxes and thousands of yuan.\\n\\nStorage cost: 0.2 thousand yuan per week per thousand boxes of surplus.\\n\\nWe need to decide how much to produce each week. Let\\'s define:\\n- Let x_i be the production quantity in week i (in thousands of boxes)\\n- Let s_i be the surplus at the end of week i (in thousands of boxes)\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. Production must meet demand each week: x_i ≥ demand_i\\n2. Production cannot exceed capacity: x_i ≤ capacity_i\\n3. Surplus is production minus demand minus any previous surplus? Actually, surplus is what\\'s left after meeting demand. So:\\n   s_0 = 0 (initial inventory)\\n   s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i - demand_i for i = 1 to 4\\n   But wait, the problem says \"surplus of beverages after meeting the demand each week\". So surplus is what\\'s left after meeting demand. So:\\n   s_i = x_i - demand_i if x_i > demand_i, else 0? Actually, if production is less than demand, then there\\'s no surplus, but we might have to carry over from previous weeks. Let me think carefully.\\n\\nActually, the surplus at the end of week i is the amount produced in week i minus the demand in week i, plus any surplus from previous weeks. But if production is less than demand, then we would have to use inventory from previous weeks. However, the problem doesn\\'t mention inventory from previous weeks. It only mentions storage cost for surplus after meeting demand each week. So I think the surplus is only what is produced in that week minus the demand in that week, and any excess is stored. But if production is less than demand, then there\\'s no surplus, but we might have to use inventory from previous weeks. However, the problem doesn\\'t specify that we can carry over inventory from previous weeks. It only says \"when there is a surplus of beverages after meeting the demand each week\". So I think we can assume that we start with zero inventory, and we must produce exactly what is needed each week plus any surplus. But if production is less than demand, then we would not meet demand, which is not allowed. So production must be at least demand. So surplus is x_i - demand_i, and if x_i < demand_i, then surplus is negative, which means we are short. But the problem doesn\\'t mention shortages, so I think we must produce at least demand. So surplus is non-negative.\\n\\nActually, let\\'s re-read: \"When there is a surplus of beverages after meeting the demand each week, a storage cost of 0.2 thousand yuan per week per thousand boxes of beverages needs to be paid.\" So if production is more than demand, then the excess is stored and incurs storage cost. If production is exactly demand, no storage cost. If production is less than demand, then there is no surplus, but we might have to use inventory from previous weeks. However, the problem doesn\\'t mention inventory from previous weeks. It only mentions storage cost for surplus after meeting demand each week. So I think we can assume that we start with zero inventory, and we must produce exactly what is needed each week plus any surplus. But if production is less than demand, then we would not meet demand, which is not allowed. So production must be at least demand. So surplus is x_i - demand_i, and if x_i < demand_i, then surplus is negative, which means we are short. But the problem doesn\\'t mention shortages, so I think we must produce at least demand. So surplus is non-negative.\\n\\nActually, let\\'s think about the total demand: 15+25+35+25 = 100 (in thousands of boxes). Total capacity: 30+40+45+20 = 135. So we can produce more than demand. But we need to decide how much to produce each week to minimize total cost.\\n\\nThe total cost includes:\\n1. Production cost: sum over weeks of (production quantity * cost per 1000 boxes)\\n2. Storage cost: for each week, if there is surplus, then storage cost = surplus * 0.2\\n\\nBut what is the surplus? It\\'s the amount produced in that week minus the demand in that week, because any excess is stored. But if we produce more than demand in week 1, then that surplus is stored and incurs storage cost for week 1. Then in week 2, if we produce more than demand in week 2, then that surplus is stored and incurs storage cost for week 2. But if we produce more than demand in week 1, then that surplus is carried over to week 2 and incurs storage cost for both weeks? Actually, the problem says \"storage cost of 0.2 thousand yuan per week per thousand boxes of beverages needs to be paid.\" So if we have surplus at the end of week 1, that surplus is stored and incurs storage cost for week 1. Then in week 2, if we produce more than demand, that surplus is stored and incurs storage cost for week 2. But the surplus from week 1 is still stored and incurs storage cost for week 2 as well? Actually, the problem says \"after meeting the demand each week\", so the surplus is what is left after meeting demand in that week. So if we produce x_i in week i, then after meeting demand d_i, we have surplus s_i = x_i - d_i. That surplus is stored and incurs storage cost for that week. But if we have surplus from previous weeks, that would be carried over and also incur storage cost. However, the problem doesn\\'t mention carrying over inventory from previous weeks. It only mentions storage cost for surplus after meeting demand each week. So I think we can assume that we start with zero inventory, and we must produce exactly what is needed each week plus any surplus. But if production is less than demand, then we would not meet demand, which is not allowed. So production must be at least demand. So surplus is x_i - d_i, and if x_i < d_i, then surplus is negative, which means we are short. But the problem doesn\\'t mention shortages, so I think we must produce at least demand. So surplus is non-negative.\\n\\nActually, let\\'s think about the total production. We have total demand 100, and total capacity 135. So we can produce more than demand. But we need to decide how much to produce each week to minimize total cost.\\n\\nThe total cost is:\\nTotal cost = sum_{i=1}^4 (production cost_i) + sum_{i=1}^4 (storage cost_i)\\nWhere:\\nproduction cost_i = x_i * cost_i\\nstorage cost_i = s_i * 0.2, where s_i = x_i - d_i if x_i > d_i, else 0? Actually, if x_i < d_i, then there is no surplus, so storage cost_i = 0. But then we would be short, which is not allowed. So we must have x_i ≥ d_i. So s_i = x_i - d_i ≥ 0.\\n\\nBut wait, if we produce more than demand in week 1, then that surplus is stored and incurs storage cost for week 1.

Actually, the problem doesn\\'t specify whether the storage cost is per week for the surplus at the end of that week. So I think we can assume that the storage cost is incurred for the surplus at the end of each week. So if we have surplus s_i at the end of week i, then that surplus incurs storage cost for week i.

Then in week 2, if we produce more than demand, that surplus is stored and incurs storage cost for week 2. But the surplus from week 1 is still stored and incurs storage cost for week 2 as well? Actually, the problem says \"storage cost of 0.2 thousand yuan per week per thousand boxes of beverages needs to be paid.\" So if we have surplus at the end of week 1, that surplus is stored and incurs storage cost for week 1. Then in week 2, if we produce more than demand, that surplus is stored and incurs storage cost for week 2. But the surplus from week 1 is still stored and incurs storage cost for week 2 as well? Actually, the problem doesn\\'t specify whether the storage cost is per week for the surplus at the end of that week. So I think we can assume that the storage cost is incurred for the surplus at the end of each week. So if we have surplus s_i at the end of week i, then that surplus incurs storage cost for week i. But if we have surplus from previous weeks, that would be carried over and also incur storage cost. However, the problem doesn\\'t mention carrying over inventory from previous weeks. It only mentions storage cost for surplus after meeting demand each week. So I think we can assume that we start with zero inventory, and we must produce exactly what is needed each week plus any surplus. But if production is less than demand, then we would not meet demand, which is not allowed. So production must be at least demand. So surplus is x_i - d_i, and if x_i < d_i, then surplus is negative, which means we are short. But the problem doesn\\'t mention shortages, so I think we must produce at least demand. So surplus is non-negative.\\n\\nActually, let\\'s think about the total production. We have total demand 100, and total capacity 135. So we can produce more than demand. But we need to decide how much to produce each week to minimize total cost.\\n\\nThe total cost is:\\nTotal cost = sum_{i=1}^4 (production cost_i) + sum_{i=1}^4 (storage cost_i)\\nWhere:\\nproduction cost_i = x_i * cost_i\\nstorage cost_i = s_i * 0.2, where s_i = x_i - d_i if x_i > d_i, else 0? Actually, if x_i < d_i, then there is no surplus, so storage cost_i = 0. But then we would be short, which is not allowed. So we must have x_i ≥ d_i.

       "    'en_math_model_coptpy_code': 'assistant\\n<thinking>\\nWe need to solve an operations research problem about beverage production planning over four weeks. The goal is to minimize total cost (production cost + storage cost) while meeting weekly demand.\\n\\nKey points from the problem:\\n1. There are 4 weeks.\\n2. Each week has:\\n   - Demand (in thousands of boxes)\\n   - Production capacity (in thousands of boxes)\\n   - Production cost per 1000 boxes (in thousand yuan)\\n3. If there is surplus (production > demand) at the end of a week, a storage cost of 0.2 thousand yuan per week per 1000 boxes is incurred.\\n4. The storage cost applies only if there is surplus at the end of the week.\\n5. We need to decide how much to produce each week to meet demand and possibly store for future weeks.\\n\\nLet me define variables:\\nLet x_i = production in week i (in thousands of boxes)\\nLet y_i = inventory at the end of week i (in thousands of boxes)\\nNote: y_i represents the amount of beverage that is not sold in week i and is stored for future use.\\n\\nFor each week i (from 1 to 4):\\n- Demand in week i: d_i\\n- Production capacity in week i: c_i\\n- Production cost per 1000 boxes: p_i\\n- Storage cost per 1000 boxes per week: s = 0.2\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. Production cannot exceed capacity: x_i ≤ c_i\\n2. Production must meet demand plus any inventory needed for future weeks. Actually, the inventory at the end of week i is the production in week i minus demand in week i minus any inventory carried over from previous weeks. Wait, let\\'s think carefully.\\n\\nActually, the inventory at the end of week i is the production in week i minus the demand in week i. Because if we produce x_i in week i, and demand is d_i, then the leftover (x_i - d_i) is stored for future weeks. However, if x_i < d_i, then we would have a shortage, but the problem doesn\\'t mention allowing shortages. I think we must assume that production is at least demand, because we have to meet demand. But looking at the data: in week 4, demand is 25 and production capacity is 20, so maximum production is 20, but demand is 25, so we cannot meet demand if we only produce in week 4. That suggests we need to carry inventory from previous weeks.\\n\\nSo the inventory at the end of week i must be non-negative and also satisfy that the total production over the weeks meets demand.\\n\\nLet me think of it as:\\nAt the beginning of week 1, inventory = 0\\nAt the end of week i, inventory = inventory at the beginning of week i + production in week i - demand in week i\\nBut inventory at the beginning of week i is the inventory from the end of week i-1.\\n\\nSo we can define:\\nLet I_i be inventory at the beginning of week i (in thousands of boxes)\\nThen:\\nI_1 = 0\\nI_i+1 = I_i + x_i - d_i for i = 1,2,3,4\\n\\nAlso, we must have I_i ≥ 0 because inventory cannot be negative.\\n\\nStorage cost is incurred if there is surplus, which means if production exceeds demand, so x_i > d_i, then we have surplus, and we pay storage cost on that surplus. But wait: the storage cost is 0.2 per week per 1000 boxes, so if we produce x_i and demand is d_i, then the amount stored is x_i - d_i, and we pay 0.2 * (x_i - d_i) for that week. But if x_i = d_i, then no storage cost. If x_i < d_i, then no storage cost because there is no surplus.\\n\\nSo the storage cost for week i is max(x_i - d_i, 0) * s, where s = 0.2.\\n\\nBut wait: actually, the storage cost is incurred on the inventory at the end of the week. So if we produce x_i and demand d_i, the inventory at the end of week i is x_i - d_i (assuming we start with zero inventory at the beginning of week i). But if we start with some inventory from previous weeks, then the surplus is the total production minus demand minus previous inventory? No, the inventory at the beginning of week i is what we carry over from previous weeks. Then production in week i is x_i, demand is d_i, so the inventory at the end of week i is I_i + x_i - d_i. That is the total amount stored at the end of week i.\\n\\nSo the storage cost for week i is the amount stored at the end of week i multiplied by the storage cost per 1000 boxes per week. So storage cost for week i = max(I_i + x_i - d_i, 0) * s. But I_i is the inventory at the beginning of week i, which is the inventory from previous weeks.\\n\\nBut actually, the storage cost is only on the surplus at the end of the week. If production exactly meets demand, then there\\'s no storage cost. If production exceeds demand, then the excess is stored and incurs storage cost. If production is less than demand, then there\\'s no storage cost because there\\'s no surplus.\\n\\nSo the total cost = sum of production costs + sum of storage costs.\\n\\nProduction cost = sum over i of p_i * x_i\\n\\nStorage cost = sum over i of s * max(I_i + x_i - d_i, 0)\\n\\nBut we need to define I_i properly.\\n\\nLet me write the model step by step.\\n\\nDecision variables:\\nx_i: production in week i (in thousands of boxes)\\nI_i: inventory at the beginning of week i (in thousands of boxes)\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. I_1 = 0\\n2. For i = 1 to 4:\\n   I_{i+1} = I_i + x_i - d_i\\n   I_{i+1} ≥ 0\\n3. x_i ≤ c_i\\n4. x_i ≥ 0\\n5. I_i ≥ 0\\n\\nStorage cost for week i = s * max(I_i + x_i - d_i, 0) = s * max(I_{i+1}, 0) because I_{i+1} = I_i + x_i - d_i\\n\\nBut actually, if I_{i+1} is negative, that means we have a shortage, but we have I_i ≥ 0 and x_i ≥ 0, so I_i + x_i ≥ 0, and if d_i > I_i + x_i, then I_{i+1} = I_i + x_i - d_i < 0, which would mean negative inventory, which is not allowed. So we must have I_i + x_i ≥ d_i for all i. But I_i is inventory at the beginning of week i, and x_i is production in week i. So total available in week i is I_i + x_i, which must be at least d_i to meet demand. So we have:\\nI_i + x_i ≥ d_i for all i\\nThis ensures that demand is met.\\n\\nSo we can simplify: I_{i+1} = I_i + x_i - d_i ≥ 0 because we have I_i + x_i ≥ d_i, so I_{i+1} ≥ 0.\\n\\nThus, the model becomes:\\nMinimize: sum_i (p_i * x_i) + s * sum_i (I_i + x_i - d_i) if I_i + x_i > d_i, else 0.\\n\\nBut since we have I_i + x_i ≥ d_i, we can write the storage cost as s * (I_i + x_i - d_i) because it\\'s non-negative.\\n\\nBut wait: actually, the storage cost is only on the surplus at the end of the week, which is I_i + x_i - d_i if positive, otherwise zero. But we have I_i + x_i ≥ d_i, so it\\'s always non-negative. So we can write storage cost as s * (I_i + x_i - d_i).\\n\\nBut note that I_i is the inventory at the beginning of week i. So the storage cost for week i is s * (I_i + x_i - d_i).\\n\\nThus, total cost = sum_i (p_i * x_i) + s * sum_i (I_i + x_i - d_i) = sum_i (p_i + s) * x_i + s * sum_i I_i - s * sum_i d_i\\n\\nBut sum_i d_i is a constant, so we can ignore it in the minimization (since it doesn\\'t depend on variables). So we can minimize sum_i (p_i + s) * x_i + s * sum_i I_i.\\n\\nBut we also have the constraints I_{i+1} = I_i + x_i - d_i for i = 1,2,3,4.\\n\\nThis is a linear programming problem.\\n\\nLet me check the data:\\nWeek 1: d_1 = 15, c_1 = 30, p_1 = 5.0\\nWeek 2: d_2 = 25, c_2 = 40, p_2 = 5.1\\nWeek 3: d_3 = 35, c_3 = 45, p_3 = 5.4\\nWeek 4: d_4 = 25, c_4 = 20, p_4 = 5.5\\ns = 0.2\\n\\nSo we need to decide x_i and I_i.\\n\\nAlso, note that in week 4, production capacity is 20, but demand is 25, so if we only produce in week 4, we cannot meet demand. So we must carry inventory from previous weeks.\\n\\nThus, the model should be feasible.\\n\\nNow I\\'ll formulate the mathematical model.\\n</thinking>\\n<model>\\nDecision Variables:\\nLet \\\\( x_i \\\\) be the production quantity in week \\\\( i \\\\) (in thousands of boxes).\\nLet \\\\( I_i \\\\) be the inventory at the beginning of week \\\\( i \\\\) (in thousands of boxes).\\n\\nParameters:\\n- Demand in week \\\\( i \\\\): \\\\( d_i \\\\) (given in the table)\\n- Production capacity in week \\\\( i \\\\): \\\\( c_i \\\\) (given in the table)\\n- Production cost per 1000 boxes in week \\\\( i \\\\): \\\\( p_i \\\\) (given in the table)\\n- Storage cost per 1000 boxes per week: \\\\( s = 0.2 \\\\) (thousand yuan)\\n\\nObjective Function:\\nMinimize total cost, which includes production cost and storage cost.\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\min \\\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\\\left( p_i x_i + s (I_i + x_i - d_i) \\\\right)\\n\\\\]\\nSince \\\\( s \\\\sum d_i \\\\) is constant, it can be ignored in the minimization. So the objective becomes:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\min \\\\sum_{i=1}^{4} (p_i + s) x_i + s \\\\sum_{i=1}^{4} I_i\\n\\\\]\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. Inventory at the beginning of week 1 is 0:\\n   \\\\[\\n   I_1 = 0\\n   \\\\]\\n2. For each week \\\\( i \\\\) (from 1 to 4), inventory at the beginning of week \\\\( i+1 \\\\) is:\\n   \\\\[\\n   I_{i+1} = I_i + x_i - d_i\\n   \\\\]\\n3. Non-negativity of inventory at the beginning of each week:\\n   \\\\[\\n   I_i \\\\geq 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{for } i = 1, 2, 3, 4\\n   \\\\]\\n4.

The goal is to minimize total cost (production cost + storage cost) while meeting weekly demand. \\n\\nKey information:\\n- There are 4 weeks.\\n- Each week has:\\n  - Demand (in thousands of boxes)\\n  - Production capacity (in thousands of boxes)\\n  - Production cost per thousand boxes (in thousand yuan)\\n- Storage cost: 0.2 thousand yuan per week per thousand boxes if there\\'s surplus after meeting demand.\\n- Surplus is inventory carried over from previous weeks.\\n- We need to decide how much to produce each week.\\n\\nDecision variables: Let x_i be the production quantity (in thousands of boxes) for week i, i=1,2,3,4.\\n\\nWe need to track inventory levels week by week. Let I_i be inventory at the end of week i (in thousands of boxes).\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. Demand must be met each week: x_i ≥ Demand_i for each week i.\\n2. Production cannot exceed capacity: x_i ≤ Capacity_i for each week i.\\n3. Inventory at the start of week i = Inventory at end of week i-1 (initial inventory assumed 0).\\n4. Inventory at end of week i = Production in week i - Demand in week i + Inventory from previous week.\\n5. Storage cost is incurred on surplus inventory after meeting demand each week. So if production in week i exceeds demand, the surplus (x_i - Demand_i) is stored and incurs storage cost of 0.2 per thousand boxes per week.\\n\\nTotal cost = sum of production costs + sum of storage costs.\\nProduction cost = sum over weeks of (x_i * Cost_i)\\nStorage cost = sum over weeks of (max(0, x_i - Demand_i) * 0.2)  [surplus inventory stored]\\n\\nActually, the storage cost applies to the surplus after meeting demand each week. So if we produce x_i in week i and demand D_i, then the surplus is x_i - D_i, and this surplus is carried over to the next week. But the storage cost is per week per thousand boxes. So if we have surplus S_i = x_i - D_i at the end of week i, then this surplus incurs storage cost of 0.2*S_i for that week.\\n\\nBut wait: The problem says \"When there is a surplus of beverages after meeting the demand each week, a storage cost of 0.2 thousand yuan per week per thousand boxes of beverages needs to be paid.\" So the storage cost is applied to the surplus after meeting demand in that week. That means the storage cost for week i is 0.2 times the surplus at the end of week i.\\n\\nHowever, note that the surplus at the end of week i becomes the inventory that starts week i+1. So the surplus in week i is stored and incurs storage cost for that week, and then carried over to the next week.\\n\\nLet me formalize this.\\n\\nLet D_i = demand in week i\\nLet C_i = capacity in week i\\nLet P_i = production cost per thousand boxes in week i\\nLet S = storage cost per thousand boxes per week = 0.2\\n\\nDecision variables:\\nx_i = production in week i (in thousands of boxes)\\nI_i = inventory at the end of week i (in thousands of boxes)\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. x_i ≥ D_i for each week i (demand must be met)\\n2. x_i ≤ C_i for each week i (capacity constraint)\\n3. I_0 = 0 (initial inventory is 0)\\n4. I_i = x_i - D_i + I_{i-1} for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 (inventory recursion)\\n   - This means: inventory at end of week i = production in week i minus demand in week i plus inventory from previous week\\n5. x_i ≥ 0 for all i\\n\\nObjective: Minimize total cost = sum_i (x_i * P_i) + sum_i (I_i * S)\\n\\nBut wait, the storage cost is 0.2 per thousand boxes per week for the surplus after meeting demand. The surplus after meeting demand in week i is exactly I_i (since I_i = x_i - D_i + I_{i-1}, and x_i - D_i is the surplus from production minus demand, plus previous inventory). So I_i represents the total inventory at the end of week i, which includes both the surplus from this week and the carried over inventory from previous weeks. However, the storage cost is per thousand boxes per week for the inventory at the end of the week. So yes, I_i * S is the storage cost for that week.\\n\\nBut actually, let\\'s think: The storage cost applies to the surplus after meeting demand each week. That surplus is exactly x_i - D_i, and then that surplus plus previous inventory becomes the new inventory. But the storage cost is applied to the inventory at the end of the week. So if we have I_i = x_i - D_i + I_{i-1}, then the storage cost for week i is I_i * S.\\n\\nBut wait, that would include the inventory carried over from previous weeks. The problem says \"surplus after meeting the demand each week\" - this suggests that only the surplus produced in that week incurs storage cost? Or does the storage cost apply to all inventory at the end of the week?\\n\\nThe wording: \"When there is a surplus of beverages after meeting the demand each week, a storage cost of 0.2 thousand yuan per week per thousand boxes of beverages needs to be paid.\"\\n\\nThis means that for each week, if there is any surplus (i.e., if production exceeds demand), then that surplus incurs storage cost. But the surplus after meeting demand is exactly x_i - D_i (the amount produced beyond what\\'s needed to meet demand). Then this surplus is stored along with any inventory from previous weeks.\\n\\nBut the storage cost is per thousand boxes per week. So if we have I_i = x_i - D_i + I_{i-1}, then the total inventory at the end of week i includes both the surplus from this week and the carried over inventory. But the storage cost should only be for the surplus produced in this week? Or for the total inventory?\\n\\nActually, the storage cost is applied to the inventory at the end of the week. That inventory includes all inventory from previous weeks plus the surplus from this week. So the storage cost for that week is I_i * S.\\n\\nBut let\\'s look at the problem statement more carefully: \"When there is a surplus of beverages after meeting the demand each week, a storage cost of 0.2 thousand yuan per week per thousand boxes of beverages needs to be paid.\"\\n\\nThis suggests that the storage cost is for the surplus after meeting demand, which is x_i - D_i. But then that surplus plus previous inventory becomes the new inventory. But the storage cost should be for the total inventory at the end of the week.\\n\\nActually, the standard interpretation of such problems is that the storage cost applies to the inventory at the end of the period. That is, if you have I_i units of inventory at the end of week i, then you pay I_i * S for storage for that week.\\n\\nSo our objective is:\\nMinimize total cost = sum_i (x_i * P_i) + sum_i (I_i * S)\\n\\nSubject to:\\nx_i ≥ D_i\\nx_i ≤ C_i\\nI_i = x_i - D_i + I_{i-1}\\nI_0 = 0\\n\\nThis is a simple linear programming problem.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s plug in the numbers from Table 1.\\n\\nWeek 1:\\nD_1 = 15\\nC_1 = 30\\nP_1 = 5.0\\n\\nWeek 2:\\nD_2 = 25\\nC_2 = 40\\nP_2 = 5.1\\n\\nWeek 3:\\nD_3 = 35\\nC_3 = 45\\nP_3 = 5.4\\n\\nWeek 4:\\nD_4 = 25\\nC_4 = 20\\nP_4 = 5.5\\n\\nStorage cost S = 0.2 per thousand boxes per week.\\n\\nSo we have:\\nDecision variables: x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 (production in thousands of boxes)\\nInventory variables: I_0 = 0, I_1, I_2, I_3, I_4\\n\\nObjective: Minimize 5.0*x_1 + 5.1*x_2 + 5.4*x_3 + 5.5*x_4 + 0.2*(I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + I_4)\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. x_1 ≥ 15, x_1 ≤ 30\\n2. x_2 ≥ 25, x_2 ≤ 40\\n3. x_3 ≥ 35, x_3 ≤ 45\\n4. x_4 ≥ 25, x_4 ≤ 20  (Note: capacity in week 4 is 20, but demand is 25. So x_4 must be at least 25, but capacity is 20, which is less than demand. This is impossible unless we can carry over inventory from previous weeks.\\n\\nActually, looking at week 4: demand is 25, capacity is 20. So to meet demand, we need at least 25 production in week 4, but capacity is only 20. So we cannot meet demand in week 4 with production alone. We must have inventory from previous weeks to meet demand.\\n\\nSo the constraint for week 4: x_4 + I_3 ≥ D_4 = 25. But I_3 is the inventory at the end of week 3, which is x_3 - D_3 + I_2, and I_2 = x_2 - D_2 + I_1, and I_1 = x_1 - D_1.\\n\\nBut in our formulation, we only have x_i ≥ D_i. That ensures that each week\\'s production meets demand, but in week 4, that would require x_4 ≥ 25, but capacity is only 20. So the model as formulated will be infeasible because x_4 cannot satisfy both x_4 ≥ 25 and x_4 ≤ 20.\\n\\nThis suggests that our interpretation is incorrect. Perhaps the constraint is not x_i ≥ D_i, but rather x_i + I_{i-1} ≥ D_i, because demand can be met by both production in week i and inventory carried over from previous weeks.\\n\\nRe-reading: \"How should the production plan be arranged to minimize the total cost (the sum of production cost and storage cost) over the four weeks while meeting the weekly market demand?\"\\n\\nThis means that demand must be met each week, but demand can be met by production in that week plus inventory carried over from previous weeks.\\n\\nSo the constraint should be: x_i + I_{i-1} ≥ D_i for each week i.\\n\\nThen, the surplus after meeting demand in week i is max(0, x_i - (D_i - I_{i-1})) = max(0, x_i + I_{i-1} - D_i - I_{i-1} + I_{i-1})? Wait.\\n\\nActually, if we have inventory I_{i-1} at the start of week i, and we produce x_i, then total available for demand is x_i + I_{i-1}. To meet demand D_i, we need x_i + I_{i-1} ≥ D_i. The amount used to meet demand is min(x_i + I_{i-1}, D_i). The surplus is x_i + I_{i-1} - D_i if x_i + I_{i-1} > D_i. That surplus is carried over as I_i = x_i + I_{i-1} - D_i.\\n\\nBut then the storage cost for week i is I_i * S, because that is the surplus after meeting demand.\\n\\nSo the correct constraints are:\\n1. x_i ≥ 0\\n2. x_i ≤ C_i\\n3. x_i + I_{i-1} ≥ D_i\\n4. I_i = x_i + I_{i-1} - D_i if x_i + I_{i-1} > D_i, but actually I_i = max(0, x_i + I_{i-1} - D_i). But since we have I_i = x_i + I_{i-1} - D_i, and we also have x_i + I_{i-1} ≥ D_i, then I_i ≥ 0 automatically.\\n\\nActually, from 3, x_i + I_{i-1} ≥ D_i, so I_i = x_i + I_{i-1} - D_i ≥ 0.\\n\\nSo the inventory constraints are:\\nI_i = x_i + I_{i-1} - D_i for i = 1, 2, 3, 4\\nI_0 = 0\\n\\nThen the objective is:\\nMinimize total cost = sum_i (x_i * P_i) + sum_i (I_i * S)\\n\\nThis makes sense because in week 4, we can use inventory from week 3 to meet demand even if production in week 4 is less than demand.\\n\\nSo with this formulation, the constraints for week 4 are:\\nx_4 + I_3 ≥ 25\\nx_4 ≤ 20\\nI_3 ≥ 0\\n\\nSince I_3 = x_3 + I_2 - D_3 = x_3 + I_2 - 35\\nI_2 = x_2 + I_1 - D_2 = x_2 + I_1 - 25\\nI_1 = x_1 + I_0 - D_1 = x_1 - 15\\n\\nSo I_3 = x_3 + x_2 + x_1 - 15 - 25 - 35 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 - 75\\n\\nThen for week 4: x_4 + (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 - 75) ≥ 25\\n=> x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 ≥ 100\\n\\nBut total demand is 100, so we need to produce at least 100 total over the four weeks, considering inventory carryover.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s formulate the model properly.\\n\\nDecision variables:\\nx_1, x_2, x_3, x_4: production in thousands of boxes for weeks 1-4\\nI_1, I_2, I_3, I_4: inventory at the end of weeks 1-4\\n\\nObjective: Minimize 5.0*x_1 + 5.1*x_2 + 5.4*x_3 + 5.5*x_4 + 0.2*(I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + I_4)\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1. x_1 ≥ 0, x_1 ≤ 30\\n2. x_2 ≥ 0, x_2 ≤ 40\\n3. x_3 ≥ 0, x_3 ≤ 45\\n4. x_4 ≥ 0, x_4 ≤ 20\\n5. I_0 = 0\\n6. I_1 = x_1 + I_0 - D_1 = x_1 - 15\\n7. I_2 = x_2 + I_1 - D_2 = x_2 + (x_1 - 15) - 25 = x_1 + x_2 - 40\\n8. I_3 = x_3 + I_2 - D_3 = x_3 + (x_1 + x_2 - 40) - 35 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 - 75\\n9. I_4 = x_4 + I_3 - D_4 = x_4 + (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 - 75) - 25 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 - 100\\n10. Demand satisfaction: x_i + I_{i-1} ≥ D_i for each week i\\n   - For week 1: x_1 ≥ 15 (since I_0 = 0, so x_1 ≥ D_1)\\n   - For week 2: x_2 + I_1 ≥ D_2 => x_2 + (x_1 - 15) ≥ 25 => x_1 + x_2 ≥ 40\\n   - For week 3: x_3 + I_2 ≥ D_3 => x_3 + (x_1 + x_2 - 40) ≥ 35 => x_1 + x_2 + x_3 ≥ 75\\n   - For week 4: x_4 + I_3 ≥ D_4 => x_4 + (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 - 75) ≥ 25 => x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 ≥ 100\\n\\nNote that constraints 6-9 are the inventory equations, and constraints 10-13 are the demand satisfaction constraints.\\n\\nActually, constraints 6-9 are derived from the demand satisfaction constraints when I_{i-1} is expressed in terms of previous variables. So we can use either the inventory equations or the demand satisfaction constraints. But since we have inventory equations, we can use them directly.\\n\\nSo the complete model is:\\n\\nMinimize 5.0*x_1 + 5.1*x_2 + 5.4*x_3 + 5.5*x_4 + 0.2*(I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + I_4)\\n\\nSubject to:\\n1. 0 ≤ x_1 ≤ 30\\n2. 0 ≤ x_2 ≤ 40\\n3. 0 ≤ x_3 ≤ 45\\n4. 0 ≤ x_4 ≤ 20\\n5. I_1 = x_1 - 15\\n6. I_2 = x_2 + I_1 - 25\\n7. I_3 = x_3 + I_2 - 35\\n8. I_4 = x_4 + I_3 - 25\\n9. x_1 + x_2 ≥ 40 (derived from demand in week 2)\\n10. x_1 + x_2 + x_3 ≥ 75 (derived from demand in week 3)\\n11. x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 ≥ 100 (derived from demand in week 4)\\n\\nBut note that constraint 11 is redundant if we have constraint 5 (I_0 = 0), and the inventory equations. Because I_4 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 - 100, and I_4 ≥ 0 (since inventory can\\'t be negative), so x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 ≥ 100.\\n\\nActually, I_4 = x_4 + I_3 - D_4 = x_4 + (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 - 75) - 25 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 - 100\\nAnd I_4 ≥ 0, so x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 ≥ 100.\\n\\nSo we can include that as a constraint.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s code this in Python using coptpy.\\n\\nWe\\'ll create decision variables for production (x1, x2, x3, x4) and inventory (I1, I2, I3, I4).\\n\\nWe\\'ll set up the objective function.\\n\\nWe\\'ll add constraints for production bounds.\\n\\nWe\\'ll add constraints for inventory equations.\\n\\nWe\\'ll add constraints for demand satisfaction (or equivalently, the derived constraints).\\n\\nActually, the inventory equations can be used to calculate I1, I2, I3, I4, and then we can add a constraint that I4 ≥ 0 to ensure we meet demand in week 4. But we also need to ensure that I1, I2, I3 are non-negative.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can add constraints that I1 ≥ 0, I2 ≥ 0, I3 ≥ 0, I4 ≥ 0.\\n\\nBut since I1 = x1 - 15, and x1 ≥ 15, I1 ≥ 0 automatically.\\n\\nI2 = x2 + I1 - 25 = x2 + x1 - 15 - 25 = x1 + x2 - 40. So I2 ≥ 0 means x1 + x2 ≥ 40.\\n\\nI3 = x3 + I2 - 35 = x3 + x1 + x2 - 40 - 35 = x1 + x2 + x3 - 75. So I3 ≥ 0 means x1 + x2 + x3 ≥ 75.\\n\\nI4 = x4 + I3 - 25 = x4 + x1 + x2 + x3 - 75 - 25 = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 - 100. So I4 ≥ 0 means x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 ≥ 100.\\n\\nSo we can just add constraints that I1, I2, I3, I4 ≥ 0, and those will be equivalent to the demand satisfaction constraints.\\n\\nBut we can also add the derived constraints directly.\\n\\nI think adding the derived constraints is clearer.\\n\\nSo in code, we\\'ll create variables for x1, x2, x3, x4, and I1, I2, I3, I4.\\n\\nWe\\'ll set bounds for x1-x4.\\n\\nWe\\'ll add constraints I1 = x1 - 15, I2 = x2 + I1 - 25, etc.\\n\\nWe\\'ll add I1, I2, I3, I4 ≥ 0.\\n\\nWe\\'ll add the objective function.\\n\\nLet\\'s implement this.\\n</thinking>\\n<model>\\nDecision Variables:\\nLet \\\\( x_i \\\\) be the production quantity (in thousands of boxes) for week \\\\( i \\\\), where \\\\( i = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\\\).\\nLet \\\\( I_i \\\\) be the inventory at the end of week \\\\( i \\\\) (in thousands of boxes), where \\\\( i = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\\\).\\n\\nParameters:\\n- Demand per week: \\\\( D_1 = 15 \\\\), \\\\( D_2 = 25 \\\\), \\\\( D_3 = 35 \\\\), \\\\( D_4 = 25 \\\\)\\n- Production capacity per week: \\\\( C_1 = 30 \\\\), \\\\( C_2 = 40 \\\\), \\\\( C_3 = 45 \\\\), \\\\( C_4 = 20 \\\\)\\n- Production cost per week: \\\\( P_1 = 5.0 \\\\), \\\\( P_2 = 5.1 \\\\), \\\\( P_3 = 5.4 \\\\), \\\\( P_4 = 5.5 \\\\)\\n- Storage cost per week per thousand boxes: \\\\( S = 0.2 \\\\)\\n\\nObjective Function:\\nMinimize total cost:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\min \\\\sum_{i=1}^{4} (x_i \\\\cdot P_i) + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{4} (I_i \\\\cdot S)\\n\\\\]\\n\\nConstraints:\\n1.
