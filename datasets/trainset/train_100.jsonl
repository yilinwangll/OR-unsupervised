{"question": "As one of the main arteries of urban transportation, the city subway carries a huge passenger flow and its operation and management are very complex. Among them, crew scheduling is one of the key links in subway operation management and also the starting point and difficulty of crew management. The subway transportation volume is large, with complex and changing routes, and frequent operation intervals. Crew drivers face huge, continuous, and high-intensity transportation tasks. It is important to arrange the driver's shift and duty mode reasonably and achieve the optimal allocation of personnel to ensure the efficient and stable operation of the subway. Due to the increasing complexity of the subway operation network, traditional manual scheduling methods can no longer meet the high standard operation requirements. Automated and intelligent crew scheduling has become an inevitable trend.\n\nThe general process of crew scheduling for subway operating companies is as follows: export train operation section and time information tables based on the current operation chart, manually divide the crew duty roster based on these information tables, compile the crew scheduling master table based on the duty roster, and finally allocate the crew groups based on the scheduling master table to form the final scheduling table. The entire process relies on manual compilation and mainly has the following three major problems:\n\n1. Low scheduling efficiency: Crew scheduling business rules are complex, and the workload is large. The efficiency of manual compilation is very low, requiring at least one week. The manpower and time costs are high.\n\n2. Difficulty in adjustment: When encountering unexpected situations such as train failures and temporary leave of crew members, it is difficult to quickly adjust the scheduling plan based on manual methods, affecting the efficiency of operation management.\n\n3. Uneven task assignment: Manual scheduling has subjective limitations and strong dependence on human experience. If the scheduling is unreasonable, it may lead to uneven task assignment, unfair scheduling, and low crew satisfaction.\n\nThis subway line includes 40 platforms, among which A, M, and Z platforms are available for driver transfers and handovers. Please consider 200 driving tasks and their attributes such as time, location, and mileage, and consider classic constraints in crew scheduling scenarios, such as maximum continuous driving time constraint, mileage limit constraint, attendance location constraint, etc. Compare different mixed integer modeling methods to minimize the number of drivers as the goal and output the optimal task chain combination (i.e. the allocation and connection relationship of all tasks) for all tasks.\n\n### Example\nMileage Information Table.csv = \\\"\"\"\nDeparture Station,Arrival

{"question": "The planning of the operation and use of arrival and departure lines at large passenger railway stations in our country is mainly carried out by dispatchers, and the adjustment of the operation plan is not flexible. In the case of a fixed scale of arrival and departure lines at the station, optimizing and improving the technical operations of trains can help improve the throughput capacity of railway stations. In order to adapt to the characteristics of railway operation and improve the efficiency of station technical operations, the feasibility and real-time performance of adjusting and optimizing station operation plans need to be continuously improved. The allocation and use of approach tracks and arrival and departure lines in the throat area of the station are key links in the preparation and adjustment of operation plans, which need to be continuously studied to meet the needs of on-site operations. The arrival and departure line of a railway refers to the route where trains stop at the station, pick up and drop off passengers, and perform dispatch operations. The arrival and departure line is usually a line or multiple lines parallel or connected to the main line, used for train entry and exit, as well as train stopping and dispatching. The allocation and preparation of arrival and departure lines for railway trains refers to the reasonable arrangement of the operation plan and stopping tracks of railway trains on different arrival and departure lines based on the needs of train operation and the conditions of arrival and departure lines.\n\n### Question Description\n\nThere are multiple optimization objectives for the allocation of railway train arrival and departure lines, such as:\n- Minimizing the dwell time of trains, reducing the waiting time for trains to park, and improving the efficiency of train operation;\n- Maximizing the speed of trains, reducing the travel time of trains, and improving the efficiency of train operation;\n- Maximizing the throughput capacity of the station, allowing the station to accommodate and dispatch more trains at the same time, and meet the travel needs of more passengers;\n- Minimizing the delay rate of trains, reducing train delays, and improving the punctuality and reliability of trains;\n- Maximizing passenger satisfaction and providing a convenient travel experience for passengers;\n- Other optimization objectives.\n\nPlease model the medium-term arrangement of approach tracks in the train station based on the job shop model. Use the COPT (Cardinal Optimizer) solver to solve this problem. Output the train timetable for each train, as well as the arrival and departure timetable for each station.\n\n### Data Introduction\n\nWe assume that a total of 16 trains are operated, and model the approach tracks and track selection in Station A. A track refers to a lane in the station where trains can stop. Each station has a certain number of tracks depending on its size, used to park different trains. The station boundary refers to the boundary of the station area, which is the dividing point between entering and leaving the station. An approach track refers to the path a train takes when entering the station and reaching a track. Generally, there are multiple approach tracks connecting different tracks in the station. Trains choose different approach tracks before entering the station, and then stop on the corresponding tracks.\n\n### Train Data\nWe consider 16 trains on the line, each with different speeds and stopping information. Each column in the table represents: train number, train speed, train stop status. \"1\" indicates that the train stops at the station, \"0\" indicates that the train does not stop at the station.\n| trainNO | speed | A | B | C | D | E | F | G |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| G1 | 350 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| G3 | 350 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| G5 | 350 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| G7 | 350 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| G9 | 350 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| G11 | 350 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| G13 | 300 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| G15 | 300 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| G17 | 300 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| G19 | 300 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| G21 | 300 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| G23 | 300 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| G25 | 300 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| G27 | 300 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| G29 | 300 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| G31 | 300 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\n### Station Data\n\nThere are 5 tracks in Station A, among which tracks I, II, and III take 4 minutes to reach the station boundary, and tracks IV and V take 5 minutes to reach the station boundary. The time to the station boundary refers to the time it takes for a train to start from a track and pass through the station boundary, including the entire process.\n\n|track|time to boundary (min)|\n|:---:|:---:|\n|I|4|\n|II|4|\n|III|4|\n|IV|5|\n|V|5|\n\nThe optional approach tracks and conflict relationships within Station A are as follows. Approach track conflict refers to the occurrence of collisions or operational impacts if two trains choose the same or intersecting approach tracks. To avoid conflicts, at any time, each approach track or any pair of intersecting approach tracks should only allow one train to use them.\n|path|from|conflict|\n|:---:|:---:|:---|\n|1|I|2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7|\n|2|I|1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7|\n|3|II|1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7|\n|4|III|1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7|\n|5|IV|1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7|\n|6|IV|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7|\n|7|V|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6|\n\nHere we assume that the approach tracks conflict with each other pairwise, and at a more detailed level of approach track arrangement, approach tracks to the same boundary may not conflict.\n\n### Other Data\n- Since Station A is the starting station, the minimum dwell time is 20 minutes.\n- The safe interval between any two trains is 3 minutes.", "answer": 16.0}

{"question": "There are six jobs, each with a specific sequence of operations that must be performed on shared machines to complete their tasks. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total time (makespan) required to complete all jobs. Each job has a predefined sequence of operations with specific processing times. Job 0 has two operations: the first takes 1 unit of time, and the second takes 6 units. Job 1 has two operations: the first takes 4 units, and the second takes 2 units. Job 2 has three operations: the first takes 9 units, the second takes 2 units, and the third takes 2 units. Job 3 has four operations: the first takes 5 units, the second takes 7 units, the third takes 6 units, and the fourth takes 3 units. Job 4 has four operations: the first takes 2 units, the second takes 9 units, the third takes 8 units, and the fourth takes 7 units. Job 5 has two operations: the first takes 4 units, and the second takes 8 units.\n\nOperations from different jobs may share the same machine, and the order in which they are processed must be determined. For example, the second operation of Job 0 and the fourth operation of Job 3 share a machine. If Job 0’s second operation starts first, it must finish before Job 3’s fourth operation begins, or vice versa. Similarly, the second operation of Job 1 and the second operation of Job 2 share a machine. If Job 1’s second operation starts first, it must finish before Job 2’s second operation begins, or vice versa.\n\nEach job’s operations must be performed in a specific order. For Job 0, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. For Job 1, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. For Job 2, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed, and the third operation cannot start until the second operation is completed. For Job 3, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed, the third operation cannot start until the second operation is completed, and the fourth operation cannot start until the third operation is completed. For Job 4, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed, the third operation cannot start until the second operation is completed, and the fourth operation cannot start until the third operation is completed. For Job 5, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total time (makespan) required to complete all operations for all jobs. The makespan is determined by the latest completion time among all operations. The constraints include precedence constraints, which ensure that each operation starts only after its preceding operation in the same job’s sequence is completed. For example, Job 0’s second operation must start at least 1 unit of time after the first operation starts. Job 1’s second operation must start at least 4 units of time after the first operation starts. Job 2’s second operation must start at least 9 units of time after the first operation starts, and the third operation must start at least 2 units of time after the second operation starts. Job 3’s second operation must start at least 5 units of time after the first operation starts, the third operation must start at least 7 units of time after the second operation starts, and the fourth operation must start at least 6 units of time after the third operation starts. Job 4’s second operation must start at least 2 units of time after the first operation starts, the third operation must start at least 9 units of time after the second operation starts, and the fourth operation must start at least 8 units of time after the third operation starts. Job 5’s second operation must start at least 4 units of time after the first operation starts.\n\nMachine capacity constraints ensure that operations sharing the same machine do not overlap. For example, if Job 0’s second operation starts first on a shared machine, it must finish before Job 3’s fourth operation begins, or vice versa. A large constant (100,000) is used to enforce the order of operations on shared machines. Non-negativity constraints ensure that all operation start times are non-negative. Binary decision variables determine the order of operations on shared machines.\n\nThe processing times for each operation are fixed and provided. The precedence constraints specify the minimum time gaps between operations. The machine capacity constraints ensure that operations on shared machines do not overlap. The decisions to be made include determining the start time for each operation for all jobs, deciding the order of operations on shared machines using binary variables, and ensuring that all constraints are satisfied while minimizing the total makespan. The objective is to minimize the total time (makespan) required to complete all operations for all jobs, ensuring that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are met.", "answer": 29.0}
{"question": "Imagine you are managing a supply chain network for a company that operates across six key locations (nodes). Each location has specific supply and demand requirements, and your goal is to optimize the flow of goods between these locations while minimizing the total cost, which includes both fixed costs for establishing connections and variable costs for shipping goods.\n\n#### Supply and Demand:\n- **Location 0** has a demand of 116 units.\n- **Location 1** has a demand of 134 units.\n- **Location 2** has no net supply or demand (balance is 0).\n- **Location 3** has a demand of 141 units.\n- **Location 4** has a demand of 8 units.\n- **Location 5** has a demand of 101 units.\n\n#### Costs and Capacities:\nTo establish a connection between any two locations, there is a fixed cost.

This ensures that all jobs are finished as quickly as possible, allowing the facility to meet client deadlines and optimize resource utilization.\n\n#### Decisions to Be Made:\n1. **Start Times**: Determine the start time for each operation of every job.\n2. **Operation Order**: Decide the order in which operations are processed on each machine, ensuring no overlaps.\n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Precedence Constraints**:\n   - Each operation in a job must start only after the previous operation in the same job has been completed. For example:\n     - Operation 1 of Job 0 must start at least 1 time unit after Operation 0 of Job 0 has finished.\n     - Operation 1 of Job 1 must start at least 1 time unit after Operation 0 of Job 1 has finished.\n     - This pattern applies to all jobs and their respective operations.\n\n2. **Machine Capacity Constraints**:\n   - No two operations assigned to the same machine can overlap in time. For example:\n     - If Operation 1 of Job 3 and Operation 0 of Job 4 are assigned to the same machine, they must be scheduled such that one starts only after the other has finished. A binary decision variable determines the order of these operations.\n     - Similar constraints apply to all pairs of operations sharing the same machine, such as:\n       - Operation 1 of Job 3 and Operation 1 of Job 4.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 3 and Operation 1 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 4 and Operation 1 of Job 4.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 4 and Operation 1 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 4 and Operation 1 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 2.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 1.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 2.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 3.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 5.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 2.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 3.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 5.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 0 of Job 3.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 1 of Job 5.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 0 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 3 and Operation 1 of Job 5.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 3 and Operation 0 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 5 and Operation 0 of Job 6.\n\n3. **Makespan Definition**:\n   - The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example:\n     - The makespan must be at least 1 time unit after the completion of Operation 0 of Job 0.\n     - The makespan must be at least 1 time unit after the completion of Operation 1 of Job 0.\n     - This applies to all operations across all jobs.\n\n4. **Non-Negativity**:\n   - All start times must be non-negative, meaning no operation can start before time zero.\n\n5. **Binary Variables**:\n   - Binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. For example:\n     - A binary variable decides whether Operation 1 of Job 3 is processed before or after Operation 0 of Job 4 on the same machine.\n     - Similar binary variables are used for all relevant pairs of operations sharing the same machine.\n\n#### Numerical Parameters:\n- The processing time for each operation is implicitly defined by the constraints, with a minimum required gap of 1 time unit between consecutive operations of the same job.\n- The large constant \\( N = 100,000 \\) is used in the machine capacity constraints to ensure that the binary variables correctly enforce the order of operations.\n\n#### Summary:\nYour task is to schedule the start times of all operations across all jobs and machines in such a way that the total completion time (makespan) is minimized. You must ensure that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are satisfied, and that the makespan reflects the latest completion time of any operation. The use of binary variables is critical to determining the correct order of operations on shared machines.", "answer": 3.0}

{"question": "Cell Tower Coverage Planning\n\nYou are tasked with planning the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 32 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by cell tower signals. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total cost of building the towers does not exceed the available budget.\n\n#### Key Details:\n1. **Population Coverage**: Each area has a specific population size that can be covered if a cell tower is built in a location that serves that area. The populations of the areas range from 2,010 to 4,970 people, with the total population across all areas being a critical factor in your decision-making.\n\n2. **Cell Tower Options**: There are 29 potential cell tower locations, each with a unique construction cost. The costs range from 210 units for Tower 1 to 498 units for Tower 6. Building a tower at any of these locations will enable coverage for specific areas, depending on the tower's range and location.\n\n3. **Coverage Requirements**: For an area to be considered covered, at least one of the cell towers that can serve it must be built. For example, Area 0 can be covered if any of Towers 0, 2, 5, 6, 11, 18, 20, 21, 26, or 27 are built. Similar coverage relationships exist for all 32 areas.\n\n4. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected cell towers must not exceed 3,226 units. This budget must be carefully allocated to maximize population coverage while staying within the financial limit.\n\n5. **Decision Variables**:\n   - **Build Decisions**: For each of the 29 cell tower locations, you must decide whether to build the tower (yes or no).\n   - **Coverage Decisions**: For each of the 32 areas, you must determine whether it will be covered (yes or no), based on the towers built.\n\n#### Objective:\nYour primary objective is to maximize the total population covered by the cell towers. This means selecting a combination of towers to build that ensures the largest possible number of people across the 32 areas have access to cell service, while staying within the budget.\n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Coverage Logic**: An area can only be considered covered if at least one of the cell towers capable of serving it is built.

{"question": "A manufacturing facility produces custom orders for two jobs, Job 0 and Job 1. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and some operations require the use of shared machinery. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total production time, or makespan, ensuring all orders are completed as quickly as possible.\n\nJob 0 has three operations: Operation 0, Operation 1, and Operation 2. Operation 1 must start at least 8 units of time after Operation 0 completes, and Operation 2 must start at least 1 unit of time after Operation 1 completes. Job 1 has six operations: Operation 0, Operation 1, Operation 2, Operation 3, Operation 4, and Operation 5. Operation 1 must start at least 5 units of time after Operation 0 completes, Operation 2 must start at least 5 units of time after Operation 1 completes, Operation 3 must start at least 7 units of time after Operation 2 completes, Operation 4 must start at least 4 units of time after Operation 3 completes, and Operation 5 must start at least 2 units of time after Operation 4 completes.\n\nSome operations from both jobs require the use of the same machine, and only one operation can be processed on a machine at any given time. The following pairs of operations share the same machine: Operation 3 and Operation 4 of Job 1, Operation 0 and Operation 1 of Job 0, Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 2 of Job 1, and Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 2 of Job 1. For each pair of operations sharing a machine, a decision must be made about which operation is processed first. This decision is represented by a binary variable, where a value of 1 indicates that the first operation in the pair is processed before the second, and a value of 0 indicates the opposite.\n\nThe primary objective is to minimize the total production time, or makespan, which is defined as the time at which the last operation across all jobs is completed. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation in both jobs. Specifically, the makespan must be at least 8 units of time after Operation 0 of Job 0 completes, at least 1 unit of time after Operation 1 of Job 0 completes, at least 4 units of time after Operation 2 of Job 0 completes, at least 5 units of time after Operation 0 of Job 1 completes, at least 5 units of time after Operation 1 of Job 1 completes, at least 7 units of time after Operation 2 of Job 1 completes, at least 4 units of time after Operation 3 of Job 1 completes, at least 2 units of time after Operation 4 of Job 1 completes, and at least 9 units of time after Operation 5 of Job 1 completes.\n\nAll operation start times must be non-negative, meaning no operation can start before time zero. For each pair of operations sharing a machine, the following must hold: if Operation A is scheduled before Operation B, then Operation B cannot start until Operation A has been completed, and conversely, if Operation B is scheduled before Operation A, then Operation A cannot start until Operation B has been completed. These constraints are enforced using a large constant (100,000) to ensure that the scheduling logic is maintained. The specific values derived from this constant, such as 99996, 99992, and 99999, are used in the constraints to enforce the sequencing logic.\n\nThe task is to determine the optimal schedule for all operations in both jobs, ensuring that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are satisfied, and that the total production time (makespan) is minimized. This involves deciding the order of operations on shared machines and ensuring that all operations are completed as quickly as possible.", "answer": 32.0}

The system consists of three types of power generators, each with unique operational characteristics and costs. Your goal is to determine the optimal number of generators to operate, the amount of power each generator should produce, and when to start up additional generators to meet the region's electricity demand at the lowest possible cost.\n\n#### Key Decisions:\n1. **Number of Generators to Operate**: For each generator type (Type 0, Type 1, Type 2) and each period (Period 0 to Period 4), decide how many generators should be active.\n2. **Power Output**: Determine the amount of power (in MW) each active generator should produce during each period.\n3. **Generator Startups**: Decide whether to start up additional generators in each period, incurring a startup cost.\n\n#### Objective:\nMinimize the total cost of operating the power generation system, which includes:\n- **Base Costs**: Each active generator incurs a fixed cost of 79 units per period, regardless of its power output.\n- **Per-MW Costs**: Each generator also incurs a variable cost based on its power output: 3 units per MW for Type 0, 4 units per MW for Type 1, and 4 units per MW for Type 2.\n- **Startup Costs**: Starting up a generator incurs a one-time cost of 355 units for Type 0 and 349 units for Types 1 and 2.\n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Demand Satisfaction**: The total power output across all generators must meet or exceed the region's electricity demand in each period.

{"question": " Cell Tower Deployment for Regional Coverage\n\nYou are tasked with deploying cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 34 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by the cell towers. Your goal is to determine which towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.\n\n#### Key Decisions:\n1. **Tower Deployment**: Decide whether to build each of the 30 available cell towers. Each tower has a unique construction cost, and building it will enable coverage for certain areas.\n2. **Area Coverage**: Determine which of the 34 areas will be covered by the deployed towers. An area is considered covered if at least one of the towers that can serve it is built.\n\n#### Objective:\nMaximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the 34 areas are as follows:\n- Area 0: 3,328 people\n- Area 1: 2,066 people\n- Area 2: 2,261 people\n- Area 3: 4,527 people\n- Area 4: 4,205 people\n- Area 5: 4,927 people\n- Area 6: 2,941 people\n- Area 7: 4,277 people\n- Area 8: 3,276 people\n- Area 9: 4,326 people\n- Area 10: 2,852 people\n- Area 11: 3,957 people\n- Area 12: 2,068 people\n- Area 13: 4,724 people\n- Area 14: 3,226 people\n- Area 15: 3,575 people\n- Area 16: 2,922 people\n- Area 17: 3,850 people\n- Area 18: 4,898 people\n- Area 19: 2,288 people\n- Area 20: 4,726 people\n- Area 21: 2,513 people\n- Area 22: 2,336 people\n- Area 23: 4,669 people\n- Area 24: 4,626 people\n- Area 25: 4,585 people\n- Area 26: 4,367 people\n- Area 27: 4,981 people\n- Area 28: 4,049 people\n- Area 29: 4,948 people\n- Area 30: 2,182 people\n- Area 31: 2,421 people\n- Area 32: 3,061 people\n- Area 33: 4,310 people\n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Coverage Requirements**: Each area must be covered by at least one of the towers that can serve it. For example:\n   - Area 0 can be covered by Towers 0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 16, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, or 27.\n   - Area 1 can be covered by Towers 0, 1, 15, 19, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, or 29.\n   - Similar coverage relationships exist for all 34 areas, as detailed in the input data.\n\n2. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed the available budget of 3,375 units.

The solution must account for the specific coverage capabilities of each tower and the population sizes of the areas.", "answer": 124268.0}
{"question": "The problem involves scheduling operations for three jobs (Job 0, Job 1, and Job 2) on shared machines to minimize the total completion time (makespan). Each job consists of a sequence of operations with specific processing times: Job 0 has two operations (Operation 0 takes 9 units of time, Operation 1 takes 8 units), Job 1 has three operations (Operation 0 takes 8 units, Operation 1 takes 8 units, Operation 2 takes 4 units), and Job 2 has four operations (Operation 0 takes 1 unit, Operation 1 takes 6 units, Operation 2 takes 4 units, Operation 3 takes 2 units). Operations within a job must follow a strict order, meaning each operation cannot start until the previous one in the same job has finished. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has completed after 9 units of time, Operation 1 of Job 1 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 1 has completed after 8 units of time, and Operation 2 of Job 1 cannot start until Operation 1 of Job 1 has completed after 8 units of time. Similarly, Operation 1 of Job 2 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 2 has completed after 1 unit of time, Operation 2 of Job 2 cannot start until Operation 1 of Job 2 has completed after 6 units of time, and Operation 3 of Job 2 cannot start until Operation 2 of Job 2 has completed after 4 units of time.\n\nCertain operations from different jobs share the same machine and cannot overlap in time. For instance, Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 2 are assigned to the same machine, so one must finish before the other starts. Similarly, Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 1 share a machine, and their schedules must not overlap. This applies to all pairs of operations sharing the same machine, such as Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2, Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 2, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 2, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 3 of Job 2, Operation 2 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 2, Operation 2 of Job 1 and Operation 3 of Job 2, and Operation 2 of Job 2 and Operation 3 of Job 2.\n\nTo enforce these constraints, binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. A large constant (100000) is used in the constraints to ensure that operations on the same machine do not overlap. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 2 are on the same machine, the constraints ensure that one operation starts only after the other has finished, using the binary variable to decide the order. The binary variables are restricted to values of 0 or 1, and the start times of operations are continuous and non-negative.\n\nThe makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, it must be at least 9 units of time (completion of Operation 0 of Job 0), 8 units (completion of Operation 1 of Job 0), 8 units (completion of Operation 0 of Job 1), 8 units (completion of Operation 1 of Job 1), 4 units (completion of Operation 2 of Job 1), 1 unit (completion of Operation 0 of Job 2), 6 units (completion of Operation 1 of Job 2), 4 units (completion of Operation 2 of Job 2), and 2 units (completion of Operation 3 of Job 2).\n\nThe objective is to determine the start times for each operation on each machine such that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are satisfied, and the total completion time (makespan) is minimized. This involves deciding the order of operations on shared machines and ensuring no overlaps, while respecting the processing times and sequence constraints of each job.", "answer": 22.0}

{"question": "Imagine you are managing a supply chain network for a company that operates across three key locations: **Node 0**, **Node 1**, and **Node 2**. Each location has specific supply and demand requirements, and your goal is to optimize the flow of goods between these nodes while minimizing the total cost of establishing connections and shipping products.\n\n#### Supply and Demand:\n- **Node 0** has a net supply of **236 units**, meaning it can provide this amount to other nodes.\n- **Node 1** has a net demand of **29 units**, requiring this amount to be fulfilled from other nodes.\n- **Node 2** has a net demand of **207 units**, which must also be met through shipments from other nodes.\n\n#### Shipping Costs and Capacities:\nTo move goods between nodes, you must decide whether to establish a connection (which incurs a fixed cost) and how much to ship (which incurs a variable cost per unit). The costs and capacities for each possible connection are as follows:\n\n1. **Node 0 to Node 1**:\n   - Fixed cost to establish the connection: **$3,532**\n   - Variable shipping cost per unit: **$45**\n   - Maximum shipping capacity: **773 units**\n\n2. **Node 0 to Node 2**:\n   - Fixed cost: **$3,895**\n   - Variable shipping cost: **$49**\n   - Maximum capacity: **973 units**\n\n3. **Node 1 to Node 0**:\n   - Fixed cost: **$3,485**\n   - Variable shipping cost: **$11**\n   - Maximum capacity: **785 units**\n\n4. **Node 1 to Node 2**:\n   - Fixed cost: **$1,845**\n   - Variable shipping cost: **$40**\n   - Maximum capacity: **787 units**\n\n5. **Node 2 to Node 0**:\n   - Fixed cost: **$1,291**\n   - Variable shipping cost: **$13**\n   - Maximum capacity: **602 units**\n\n6. **Node 2 to Node 1**:\n   - Fixed cost: **$1,818**\n   - Variable shipping cost: **$47**\n   - Maximum capacity: **766 units**\n\n#### Key Decisions:\n- For each connection between nodes, you must decide whether to establish it (a binary decision: yes or no).\n- For each established connection, you must determine the amount of goods to ship, ensuring it does not exceed the connection's capacity.\n\n#### Objective:\nYour goal is to minimize the total cost, which includes:\n1. The fixed costs of establishing the necessary connections.\n2. The variable shipping costs based on the amount of goods transported.\n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Capacity Constraints**: The amount of goods shipped between any two nodes cannot exceed the maximum capacity of that connection. For example, if you decide to ship goods from **Node 0 to Node 1**, the shipment must be **773 units or less**.\n2. **Flow Balance Constraints**: The total inflow and outflow of goods at each node must match its supply or demand. For example:\n   - At **Node 0**, the total inflow from **Node 1** and **Node 2** minus the outflow to **Node 1** and **Node 2** must equal **236 units**.\n   - At **Node 1**, the total inflow from **Node 0** and **Node 2** minus the outflow to **Node 0** and **Node 2** must equal **-29 units** (indicating a net demand).\n   - At **Node 2**, the total inflow from **Node 0** and **Node 1** minus the outflow to **Node 0** and **Node 1** must equal **-207 units** (indicating a net demand).\n\n#### Summary:\nYour task is to determine the most cost-effective way to establish connections and ship goods between **Node 0**, **Node 1**, and **Node 2** to meet the supply and demand requirements while minimizing the total cost. This involves balancing fixed and variable costs, adhering to capacity limits, and ensuring the flow of goods aligns with the needs of each node.", "answer": 7364.0}
{"question": "In a manufacturing facility, you are tasked with scheduling a set of jobs across multiple machines to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and each operation is assigned to a particular machine. The goal is to determine the start times for each operation on its assigned machine while respecting the following constraints:\n\nEach job has a predefined sequence of operations. For example, Job 0 has two operations: Operation 0 must be completed before Operation 1 can begin. Similarly, Job 1 has Operation 0 and Operation 1, with Operation 0 preceding Operation 1. This pattern applies to all jobs, ensuring that no operation starts before its predecessor in the same job has finished. Specifically, for Job 0, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed, and for Job 1, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed. This logic applies to all jobs, ensuring the correct sequence of operations.\n\nEach machine can process only one operation at a time. To prevent overlapping, the start times of operations assigned to the same machine must be carefully scheduled. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1 are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap. A binary decision variable determines the order in which these operations are processed. If Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled first, Operation 0 of Job 1 must start only after Operation 0 of Job 0 has finished, and vice versa. Similar constraints apply to all pairs of operations assigned to the same machine, ensuring no two operations overlap. A large constant (100,000) is used in the constraints to enforce the order of operations on shared machines.\n\nThe makespan is defined as the total time required to complete all jobs. It must be at least as large as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 6 finishes at time 100, the makespan must be at least 100. This ensures that the makespan accurately reflects the total time needed to complete all operations.\n\nThe start time of every operation must be non-negative, meaning no operation can start before time zero. Binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. These variables can only take values of 0 or 1, representing the scheduling decisions. The processing time for each operation is implicitly defined by the constraints. For example, the precedence constraints specify that Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has been completed, with a required gap of at least 1 time unit. The binary variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. For instance, if the binary variable for Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1 is 1, Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 0 of Job 1 on the same machine. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 finishes at time 10, the makespan must be at least 10.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring that all jobs are completed in the shortest possible time while respecting the precedence and machine capacity constraints. This problem requires determining the optimal start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines to achieve the minimum total completion time.", "answer": 3.0}

{"question": "The problem involves scheduling four jobs (Job 0, Job 1, Job 2, and Job 3) on a set of machines to minimize the total completion time (makespan). Each job consists of a sequence of operations, and each operation must be processed on a specific machine with a given processing time. Job 0 has two operations: Operation 0 takes 2 units of time, and Operation 1 takes 3 units of time. Job 1 has five operations: Operation 0 takes 8 units of time, Operation 1 takes 7 units of time, Operation 2 takes 4 units of time, Operation 3 takes 3 units of time, and Operation 4 takes 2 units of time. Job 2 has five operations: Operation 0 takes 8 units of time, Operation 1 takes 3 units of time, Operation 2 takes 7 units of time, Operation 3 takes 8 units of time, and Operation 4 takes 4 units of time. Job 3 has seven operations: Operation 0 takes 6 units of time, Operation 1 takes 4 units of time, Operation 2 takes 7 units of time, Operation 3 takes 6 units of time, Operation 4 takes 2 units of time, Operation 5 takes 8 units of time, and Operation 6 takes 9 units of time.\n\nEach operation in a job must start only after the previous operation in the same job has completed. For example, in Job 1, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has finished, and in Job 3, Operation 6 cannot start until Operation 5 has finished. No two operations can be processed on the same machine at the same time. For example, if Operation 3 of Job 1 and Operation 4 of Job 2 are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap, and the start time of one must be at least 4 units after the other, depending on the order in which they are scheduled. Similarly, Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 3 cannot overlap on the same machine, and the start time of one must be at least 7 units after the other.\n\nThe total completion time (makespan) must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, the makespan must be at least 2 units to account for the completion of Operation 0 in Job 0, and it must also be at least 9 units to account for the completion of Operation 6 in Job 3. The objective is to minimize the makespan, which involves determining the start times for each operation on each machine while respecting the precedence and machine capacity constraints. All start times must be non-negative, and the order of operations on each machine is determined by binary decision variables, which decide whether one operation starts before another on the same machine. A large constant (100000) is used in the machine capacity constraints to ensure that the constraints are only active when the binary variable is 1 or 0.\n\nThe binary decision variables, such as \\(X_{(1,3)(2,4)}\\), \\(X_{(1,3)(3,0)}\\), and others, determine the order of operations on the same machine.

{"question": "The manufacturing facility produces custom components for two jobs, Job 0 and Job 1, each consisting of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total completion time (makespan) while satisfying all operational constraints. Job 0 has five operations with processing times: Operation 0 takes 4 units, Operation 1 takes 1 unit, Operation 2 takes 6 units, Operation 3 takes 6 units, and Operation 4 takes 8 units. Job 1 has four operations with processing times: Operation 0 takes 9 units, Operation 1 takes 1 unit, Operation 2 takes 4 units, and Operation 3 takes 2 units.\n\nPrecedence constraints ensure that operations within each job are performed in sequence with specific gaps. For Job 0, Operation 1 must start at least 4 units after Operation 0 starts, Operation 2 must start at least 1 unit after Operation 1 starts, Operation 3 must start at least 6 units after Operation 2 starts, and Operation 4 must start at least 6 units after Operation 3 starts.

Specifically, the makespan must be at least 4 units after Operation 0 of Job 0 starts, 1 unit after Operation 1 of Job 0 starts, 6 units after Operation 2 of Job 0 starts, 6 units after Operation 3 of Job 0 starts, 8 units after Operation 4 of Job 0 starts, 9 units after Operation 0 of Job 1 starts, 1 unit after Operation 1 of Job 1 starts, 4 units after Operation 2 of Job 1 starts, and 2 units after Operation 3 of Job 1 starts.\n\nThe objective is to determine the start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines to minimize the makespan while respecting all precedence constraints, machine capacity constraints, and the makespan definition. Binary variables are used to enforce the correct sequencing of operations on shared machines, with a large constant of 100,000 ensuring the constraints are properly applied.

Dispersion is measured by the pairwise distances between the facilities, and your goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible to optimize coverage and minimize redundancy.\n\n#### Key Details:\n1. **Facility Selection**: You must select exactly **2 facilities** to open from the five available locations. Each location can either be chosen (1) or not chosen (0) to host a facility.\n2. **Dispersion Values**: The pairwise distances (dispersion values) between the locations are as follows:\n   - Node 0 and Node 1: 20 units\n   - Node 0 and Node 2: 20 units\n   - Node 0 and Node 3: 18 units\n   - Node 0 and Node 4: 18 units\n   - Node 1 and Node 0: 22 units\n   - Node 1 and Node 2: 21 units\n   - Node 1 and Node 3: 16 units\n   - Node 1 and Node 4: 17 units\n   - Node 2 and Node 0: 16 units\n   - Node 2 and Node 1: 23 units\n   - Node 2 and Node 3: 15 units\n   - Node 2 and Node 4: 24 units\n   - Node 3 and Node 0: 23 units\n   - Node 3 and Node 1: 16 units\n   - Node 3 and Node 2: 23 units\n   - Node 3 and Node 4: 20 units\n   - Node 4 and Node 0: 19 units\n   - Node 4 and Node 1: 21 units\n   - Node 4 and Node 2: 15 units\n   - Node 4 and Node 3: 25 units\n\n3. **Objective**: Maximize the total dispersion between the selected facilities. This means you want to choose the two facilities such that the sum of their pairwise distances is as large as possible.\n\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - **Selection Constraint**: Exactly two facilities must be selected from the five locations.\n   - **Pairwise Activation**: For any two locations, the pairwise dispersion value is only counted if both locations are selected. For example, the dispersion between Node 0 and Node 1 (20 units) is only included in the total if both Node 0 and Node 1 are chosen.\n   - **Logical Relationships**: If a location is not selected, no pairwise dispersion involving that location can be included in the total.\n\n#### Example:\nIf you select Node 0 and Node 1, the total dispersion would be 20 units (from Node 0 to Node 1). If you select Node 2 and Node 4, the total dispersion would be 24 units (from Node 2 to Node 4).

{"question": "You are tasked with optimizing the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 33 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by cell tower signals. The goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.\n\nFor each of the 29 available cell tower locations (tower_0 to tower_28), you must decide whether to build the tower (a binary decision: build or not build). For each of the 33 regions (region_0 to region_32), you must decide whether the region will be covered by at least one active cell tower (a binary decision: cover or not cover).\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the regions are as follows: Region 0: 4,901; Region 1: 2,727; Region 2: 2,994; Region 3: 2,984; Region 4: 3,693; Region 5: 2,615; Region 6: 3,354; Region 7: 4,965; Region 8: 4,223; Region 9: 4,738; Region 10: 2,345; Region 11: 3,915; Region 12: 4,068; Region 13: 2,613; Region 14: 3,140; Region 15: 4,894; Region 16: 3,503; Region 17: 3,733; Region 18: 4,275; Region 19: 3,795; Region 20: 3,803; Region 21: 3,497; Region 22: 2,403; Region 23: 3,441; Region 24: 3,116; Region 25: 2,091; Region 26: 4,494; Region 27: 3,593; Region 28: 2,090; Region 29: 3,397; Region 30: 3,973; Region 31: 2,362; Region 32: 2,068.\n\nEach region can only be considered covered if at least one of the cell towers that can serve it is built. For example, Region 0 can be covered if any of the following towers are built: Tower 1, Tower 2, Tower 3, Tower 4, Tower 5, Tower 6, Tower 9, Tower 12, Tower 14, Tower 15, Tower 16, Tower 17, Tower 19, or Tower 26. Similar constraints apply to all 33 regions, with each region having a specific set of towers that can provide coverage.\n\nThe total cost of building the selected cell towers must not exceed the available budget of 2,996 units. The costs for building each tower are as follows: Tower 0: 227; Tower 1: 355; Tower 2: 287; Tower 3: 487; Tower 4: 497; Tower 5: 412; Tower 6: 495; Tower 7: 294; Tower 8: 212; Tower 9: 290; Tower 10: 427; Tower 11: 399; Tower 12: 361; Tower 13: 253; Tower 14: 350; Tower 15: 314; Tower 16: 234; Tower 17: 203; Tower 18: 257; Tower 19: 248; Tower 20: 406; Tower 21: 264; Tower 22: 277; Tower 23: 419; Tower 24: 426; Tower 25: 297; Tower 26: 474; Tower 27: 333; Tower 28: 491.\n\nYour task is to select which cell towers to build and which regions to cover, ensuring that the total population covered is maximized while staying within the budget. Each region can only be covered if at least one of its associated towers is built, and the total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed 2,996 units. The solution must balance the trade-off between coverage and cost to achieve the best possible outcome.", "answer": 113803.0}
{"question": "The problem involves scheduling operations for three jobs (Job 0, Job 1, and Job 2) on a set of machines in a manufacturing facility to minimize the total completion time (makespan). Each job consists of a sequence of operations with specific processing times. Job 0 has 5 operations with processing times of 7, 9, 8, 3, and 9 hours. Job 1 has 6 operations with processing times of 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, and 9 hours. Job 2 has 7 operations with processing times of 9, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, and 5 hours. Each operation must start only after the previous operation in the same job has been completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed (7 hours), and Operation 1 of Job 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed (1 hour). Operations from different jobs that require the same machine must be scheduled in a specific order to avoid overlapping. Binary decision variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. For instance, if Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 0 of Job 1, the binary variable is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. A large constant (100,000) is used in the constraints to ensure they are only active when necessary. The makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. The start times for all operations must be non-negative, and the objective is to minimize the makespan while satisfying all precedence and machine capacity constraints. Specifically, the constraints include precedence constraints within each job, machine capacity constraints to prevent overlapping operations on the same machine, and makespan constraints to ensure the makespan is at least as large as the completion time of every operation. The binary variables are used to enforce the order of operations on shared machines, and the large constant ensures the constraints are only active when necessary. The start times and the makespan are continuous variables, and the binary variables are restricted to 0 or 1. The machine capacity constraints are formulated such that for each pair of operations assigned to the same machine, the start time of one operation plus its processing time must be less than or equal to the start time of the other operation plus the large constant multiplied by the complement of the binary variable. This ensures that the operations do not overlap on the same machine. The makespan constraints ensure that the makespan is at least as large as the completion time of every operation. The precedence constraints ensure that operations within the same job are scheduled in the correct order. The binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines, and the large constant is used to make the constraints active only when necessary. The start times for all operations must be non-negative, and the objective is to minimize the makespan while satisfying all constraints.", "answer": 36.0}

The separation constraints must be respected, meaning that the landing times of any two aircraft must maintain the required separation based on their order of landing. The penalty for landing early is calculated as the number of minutes early multiplied by the early penalty cost, and the penalty for landing late is calculated as the number of minutes late multiplied by the late penalty cost. The objective is to determine the landing times for all five aircraft such that the total penalty cost is minimized, and all separation requirements and landing time windows are strictly adhered to.

{"question": "The problem involves scheduling the landing times of three aircraft to minimize the total penalty costs associated with deviations from their earliest and latest possible landing times while ensuring safe separation between aircraft and adhering to their respective time windows. Each aircraft has an earliest and latest possible landing time, and penalty costs for landing early or late. Aircraft 0 has an earliest landing time of 201 minutes, a latest landing time of 261 minutes, an early penalty cost of \\$37 per minute, and a late penalty cost of \\$73 per minute. Aircraft 1 has an earliest landing time of 234 minutes, a latest landing time of 294 minutes, an early penalty cost of \\$99 per minute, and a late penalty cost of \\$84 per minute. Aircraft 2 has an earliest landing time of 29 minutes, a latest landing time of 89 minutes, an early penalty cost of \\$90 per minute, and a late penalty cost of \\$56 per minute.\n\nThe separation requirements are enforced using binary decision variables that determine the order in which the aircraft land. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 1, there must be at least 11 minutes of separation; if Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 27 minutes. If Aircraft 0 lands before Aircraft 2, there must be at least 9 minutes of separation; if Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 0, the separation must be at least 232 minutes. If Aircraft 1 lands before Aircraft 2, there must be at least 9 minutes of separation; if Aircraft 2 lands before Aircraft 1, the separation must be at least 265 minutes.\n\nThe landing time windows must be respected: Aircraft 0 must land between 201 and 261 minutes, Aircraft 1 between 234 and 294 minutes, and Aircraft 2 between 29 and 89 minutes. The penalties for early and late landings are calculated based on the difference between the actual landing time and the earliest or latest possible landing time, multiplied by the respective penalty costs. The objective is to determine the optimal landing times for all three aircraft to minimize the total penalty costs while ensuring all separation and time window constraints are satisfied. The total penalty cost is the sum of the early and late penalties for all aircraft. The order in which the aircraft land affects the separation requirements and landing times, so the schedule must balance these costs to achieve the lowest total penalty. Binary decision variables are used to determine the order of aircraft landings, ensuring that the separation constraints are enforced correctly. The constraints also ensure that the landing times are within the specified windows and that the penalties for early and late landings are calculated accurately based on the deviations from the earliest and latest possible landing times.", "answer": 0.0}

{"question": "The problem involves scheduling the landing times of three aircraft (aircraft_0, aircraft_1, and aircraft_2) to minimize the total penalty costs associated with deviations from their target landing times. Each aircraft has specific time windows within which it must land: aircraft_0 must land between 19 and 79 minutes, aircraft_1 between 58 and 118 minutes, and aircraft_2 between 205 and 265 minutes. The penalties for landing early or late are as follows: aircraft_0 incurs a penalty of 58 units per minute early and 57 units per minute late, aircraft_1 incurs 25 units per minute early and 61 units per minute late, and aircraft_2 incurs 37 units per minute early and 70 units per minute late.\n\nThe landing sequence between any two aircraft is determined by binary variables, where a value of 1 indicates that one aircraft lands before the other. The constraints ensure that the landing times respect the sequence and separation requirements. For example, if aircraft_0 lands before aircraft_1, there must be at least 4 minutes of separation, but if aircraft_1 lands before aircraft_0, the required separation is 21 minutes. Similarly, if aircraft_0 lands before aircraft_2, the separation must be at least 12 minutes, but if aircraft_2 lands before aircraft_0, the separation must be at least 126 minutes. For aircraft_1 and aircraft_2, the separation is at least 13 minutes if aircraft_1 lands first, and at least 87 minutes if aircraft_2 lands first.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total penalty costs, which include the penalties for early and late landings for all three aircraft. The constraints ensure that each aircraft lands within its specified time window, the landing sequence respects the separation requirements, and the binary variables enforce the correct sequence between aircraft pairs. The penalties for early or late landings are calculated based on the deviation from the target landing times, which are implicitly defined by the constraints on the landing times and the penalties. Specifically, the constraints ensure that the landing time of aircraft_0 plus the early penalty for aircraft_0 is at least 49 minutes, and the landing time of aircraft_0 minus the late penalty for aircraft_0 is at most 49 minutes. Similarly, the landing time of aircraft_1 plus the early penalty for aircraft_1 is at least 88 minutes, and the landing time of aircraft_1 minus the late penalty for aircraft_1 is at most 88 minutes. For aircraft_2, the landing time plus the early penalty is at least 235 minutes, and the landing time minus the late penalty is at most 235 minutes. These constraints ensure that the penalties are correctly calculated based on the deviation from the target landing times.", "answer": 0.0}
