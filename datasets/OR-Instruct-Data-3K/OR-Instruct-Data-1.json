{"prompt": "Below is an operations research question. Build a mathematical model and corresponding python code using `coptpy` that appropriately addresses the question.\n\n# Question:\nAn ecotourism company plans to carry out four projects (x1, x2, x3, x4) in different regions. These projects involve different types of tourism activities, including hiking, camping, bird watching, and wildlife research.\n\nEach project has a certain impact on the environment, which is measured on a specific Environmental Impact Index (EII). This index is expressed as a percentage, representing the negative impact each project has on the environment. The EIIs for each project are as follows:\n\n| Project | EII (%) |\n| ------- | ------- |\n| x1      | 20      |\n| x2      | 30      |\n| x3      | 40      |\n| x4      | 50      |\n\nIn addition, each project generates a certain revenue, as shown below:\n\n| Project | Revenue (USD) |\n| ------- | ------------ |\n| x1      | 10000        |\n| x2      | 20000        |\n| x3      | 30000        |\n| x4      | 40000        |\n\nDue to environmental regulations and the company's sustainable development strategy, the total EII for all projects cannot exceed 100%.
