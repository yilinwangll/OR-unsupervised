{"question": "The manufacturing facility produces custom components for two jobs, Job 0 and Job 1, each consisting of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total completion time (makespan) while satisfying all operational constraints. Job 0 has five operations with processing times: Operation 0 takes 4 units, Operation 1 takes 1 unit, Operation 2 takes 6 units, Operation 3 takes 6 units, and Operation 4 takes 8 units. Job 1 has four operations with processing times: Operation 0 takes 9 units, Operation 1 takes 1 unit, Operation 2 takes 4 units, and Operation 3 takes 2 units.\n\nPrecedence constraints ensure that operations within each job are performed in sequence with specific gaps. For Job 0, Operation 1 must start at least 4 units after Operation 0 starts, Operation 2 must start at least 1 unit after Operation 1 starts, Operation 3 must start at least 6 units after Operation 2 starts, and Operation 4 must start at least 6 units after Operation 3 starts. For Job 1, Operation 1 must start at least 9 units after Operation 0 starts, Operation 2 must start at least 1 unit after Operation 1 starts, and Operation 3 must start at least 4 units after Operation 2 starts.\n\nMachine capacity constraints ensure that operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap. Binary variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 0 are on the same machine, one must complete at least 6 units before the other starts. Similarly, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 2 of Job 1 are on the same machine, one must complete at least 4 units before the other starts. These constraints apply to all operation pairs on shared machines, ensuring no overlap and maintaining required time gaps. The large constant of 100,000 is used in these constraints to enforce the sequencing logic by ensuring that the constraints are only active when the binary variable is set to 1.\n\nThe makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. Specifically, the makespan must be at least 4 units after Operation 0 of Job 0 starts, 1 unit after Operation 1 of Job 0 starts, 6 units after Operation 2 of Job 0 starts, 6 units after Operation 3 of Job 0 starts, 8 units after Operation 4 of Job 0 starts, 9 units after Operation 0 of Job 1 starts, 1 unit after Operation 1 of Job 1 starts, 4 units after Operation 2 of Job 1 starts, and 2 units after Operation 3 of Job 1 starts.\n\nThe objective is to determine the start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines to minimize the makespan while respecting all precedence constraints, machine capacity constraints, and the makespan definition.

Each location has specific supply and demand requirements, and your goal is to optimize the flow of goods between these nodes while minimizing the total cost of establishing connections and shipping products.\n\n#### Supply and Demand:\n- **Node 0** has a net supply of **236 units**, meaning it can provide this amount to other nodes.\n- **Node 1** has a net demand of **29 units**, requiring this amount to be fulfilled from other nodes.\n- **Node 2** has a net demand of **207 units**, which must also be met through shipments from other nodes.\n\n#### Shipping Costs and Capacities:\nTo move goods between nodes, you must decide whether to establish a connection (which incurs a fixed cost) and how much to ship (which incurs a variable cost per unit). The costs and capacities for each possible connection are as follows:\n\n1. **Node 0 to Node 1**:\n   - Fixed cost to establish the connection: **$3,532**\n   - Variable shipping cost per unit: **$45**\n   - Maximum shipping capacity: **773 units**\n\n2. **Node 0 to Node 2**:\n   - Fixed cost: **$3,895**\n   - Variable shipping cost: **$49**\n   - Maximum capacity: **973 units**\n\n3. **Node 1 to Node 0**:\n   - Fixed cost: **$3,485**\n   - Variable shipping cost: **$11**\n   - Maximum capacity: **785 units**\n\n4. **Node 1 to Node 2**:\n   - Fixed cost: **$1,845**\n   - Variable shipping cost: **$40**\n   - Maximum capacity: **787 units**\n\n5. **Node 2 to Node 0**:\n   - Fixed cost: **$1,291**\n   - Variable shipping cost: **$13**\n   - Maximum capacity: **602 units**\n\n6. **Node 2 to Node 1**:\n   - Fixed cost: **$1,818**\n   - Variable shipping cost: **$47**\n   - Maximum capacity: **766 units**\n\n#### Key Decisions:\n- For each connection between nodes, you must decide whether to establish it (a binary decision: yes or no).\n- For each established connection, you must determine the amount of goods to ship, ensuring it does not exceed the connection's capacity.\n\n#### Objective:\nYour goal is to minimize the total cost, which includes:\n1. The fixed costs of establishing the necessary connections.\n2. The variable shipping costs based on the amount of goods transported.\n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Capacity Constraints**: The amount of goods shipped between any two nodes cannot exceed the maximum capacity of that connection. For example, if you decide to ship goods from **Node 0 to Node 1**, the shipment must be **773 units or less**.\n2. **Flow Balance Constraints**: The total inflow and outflow of goods at each node must match its supply or demand. For example:\n   - At **Node 0**, the total inflow from **Node 1** and **Node 2** minus the outflow to **Node 1** and **Node 2** must equal **236 units**.\n   - At **Node 1**, the total inflow from **Node 0** and **Node 2** minus the outflow to **Node 0** and **Node 2** must equal **-29 units** (indicating a net demand).\n   - At **Node 2**, the total inflow from **Node 0** and **Node 1** minus the outflow to **Node 0** and **Node 1** must equal **-207 units** (indicating a net demand).\n\n#### Summary:\nYour task is to determine the most cost-effective way to establish connections and ship goods between **Node 0**, **Node 1**, and **Node 2** to meet the supply and demand requirements while minimizing the total cost.

For each pair of operations sharing a machine, the following must hold: if Operation A is scheduled before Operation B, then Operation B cannot start until Operation A has been completed, and conversely, if Operation B is scheduled before Operation A, then Operation A cannot start until Operation B has been completed. These constraints are enforced using a large constant (100,000) to ensure that the scheduling logic is maintained. The specific values derived from this constant, such as 99996, 99992, and 99999, are used in the constraints to enforce the sequencing logic.\n\nThe task is to determine the optimal schedule for all operations in both jobs, ensuring that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are satisfied, and that the total production time (makespan) is minimized.

For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed (7 hours), and Operation 1 of Job 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed (1 hour). Operations from different jobs that require the same machine must be scheduled in a specific order to avoid overlapping. Binary decision variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. For instance, if Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 0 of Job 1, the binary variable is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. A large constant (100,000) is used in the constraints to ensure they are only active when necessary. The makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. The start times for all operations must be non-negative, and the objective is to minimize the makespan while satisfying all precedence and machine capacity constraints. Specifically, the constraints include precedence constraints within each job, machine capacity constraints to prevent overlapping operations on the same machine, and makespan constraints to ensure the makespan is at least as large as the completion time of every operation. The binary variables are used to enforce the order of operations on shared machines, and the large constant ensures the constraints are only active when necessary. The start times and the makespan are continuous variables, and the binary variables are restricted to 0 or 1. The machine capacity constraints are formulated such that for each pair of operations assigned to the same machine, the start time of one operation plus its processing time must be less than or equal to the start time of the other operation plus the large constant multiplied by the complement of the binary variable. This ensures that the operations do not overlap on the same machine. The makespan constraints ensure that the makespan is at least as large as the completion time of every operation. The precedence constraints ensure that operations within the same job are scheduled in the correct order. The binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines, and the large constant is used to make the constraints active only when necessary. The start times for all operations must be non-negative, and the objective is to minimize the makespan while satisfying all constraints.", "answer": 36, "ori": "13_optmath_bench", "index": 22}
{"question": "The problem involves scheduling four jobs (Job 0, Job 1, Job 2, and Job 3) across multiple machines to minimize the total completion time (makespan). Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and each operation is assigned to a particular machine. The processing times for each operation are as follows: Job 0 has Operation 0 (6 units), Operation 1 (8 units), and Operation 2 (9 units); Job 1 has Operation 0 (3 units), Operation 1 (8 units), Operation 2 (5 units), Operation 3 (5 units), and Operation 4 (2 units); Job 2 has Operation 0 (8 units), Operation 1 (1 unit), and Operation 2 (6 units); Job 3 has Operation 0 (1 unit), Operation 1 (9 units), Operation 2 (4 units), and Operation 3 (5 units).\n\nEach machine can process only one operation at a time. If two operations are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap in time. The order of operations on the same machine is determined by binary decision variables. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 1 are on the same machine, the binary variable determines whether Operation 0 of Job 0 is processed before Operation 3 of Job 1 or vice versa. Similar constraints apply to other operation pairs on the same machine, such as Operation 2 of Job 1 and Operation 4 of Job 1, Operation 2 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2, Operation 2 of Job 0 and Operation 3 of Job 3, Operation 0 of Job 2 and Operation 3 of Job 3, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 2, Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 2 of Job 3, and Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 2 of Job 3.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the makespan, which must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, the completion time of Operation 0 of Job 0 is at least 6 units, so the makespan must be at least 6 units. Similarly, the completion time of Operation 1 of Job 0 is at least 8 units, so the makespan must be at least 8 units. This applies to all operations, with the final operation of Job 3 requiring at least 5 units.\n\nConstraints include precedence constraints within jobs, ensuring that each operation starts only after the previous operation in the same job has completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has completed, which takes at least 6 units. Machine capacity constraints ensure that operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap, with binary variables determining the order of operations on the same machine. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation, and all start times for operations must be non-negative. Binary variables must be either 0 or 1, determining the order of operations on the same machine.\n\nThe goal is to find the optimal schedule that meets all these constraints while minimizing the total time required to complete all jobs.", "answer": 28, "ori": "13_optmath_bench", "index": 23}

{"question": "You are tasked with optimizing the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 33 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by cell tower signals. The goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.\n\nFor each of the 29 available cell tower locations (tower_0 to tower_28), you must decide whether to build the tower (a binary decision: build or not build).

{"question": "The problem involves scheduling six jobs, labeled Job 0 through Job 5, in a manufacturing facility. Each job consists of two operations that must be performed in a specific sequence. The goal is to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan, by determining the start times for all operations and the order of operations on shared machines. Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit of time. Operations within the same job must follow a strict sequence, meaning the second operation cannot start until the first operation has completed. Certain operations are assigned to the same machine, and these operations cannot overlap in time. To enforce this, binary decision variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 1 is scheduled before Operation 1 of Job 3 on the same machine, the start time of Operation 1 of Job 3 must be at least 1 unit of time after the completion of Operation 1 of Job 1. The makespan is defined as the maximum completion time across all operations, and it must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. The constraints include precedence constraints within jobs, ensuring that each operation starts only after the previous operation in the same job has completed; machine capacity constraints, ensuring that operations assigned to the same machine do not overlap; and non-negativity constraints, ensuring that all start times are non-negative. The objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring that all jobs are completed as quickly as possible. The binary decision variables, such as those determining the order of Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 3, are critical in enforcing the machine capacity constraints. The numerical parameters include a large constant (100000) used in the constraints involving binary variables to ensure the correct sequencing of operations on shared machines. The start times and the makespan are general variables that can take on any real value within the bounds defined by the constraints.", "answer": 5, "ori": "13_optmath_bench", "index": 29}

{"question": "There are five clients, labeled Client 0 to Client 4, each requiring two operations to be performed in sequence. Each operation takes exactly 1 unit of time to complete. The operations for each client must follow a strict sequence: the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed, with a minimum gap of 1 unit of time between them. Operations from different clients may need to be performed on the same machine, and no two operations can overlap on the same machine. To enforce this, binary decision variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. The goal is to minimize the total production time, known as the makespan, which is the time when the last operation across all clients is completed. The makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of every operation. Start times for all operations are continuous variables, and the binary variables ensure that operations on the same machine do not overlap.

{"question": " Facility Location for Maximum Dispersion\n\nYou are tasked with selecting a set of facilities from a network of five potential locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall dispersion between the selected facilities. Dispersion is measured by the weighted distances between pairs of facilities, where higher weights indicate greater desirability for separation. The goal is to ensure that the selected facilities are as spread out as possible, given the constraints.\n\n#### Key Decisions:\n1. **Facility Selection**: Decide which facilities to open. Each facility can either be selected (1) or not selected (0). Specifically, you must select exactly 2 facilities out of the 5 available.\n2. **Pairwise Dispersion**: Determine whether a pair of facilities contributes to the dispersion score. A pair contributes only if both facilities in the pair are selected.\n\n#### Objective:\nMaximize the total dispersion score, which is the sum of the weighted distances between all pairs of selected facilities. The weights for each pair are as follows:\n- Node 0 and Node 1: 22  \n- Node 0 and Node 2: 19  \n- Node 0 and Node 3: 24  \n- Node 0 and Node 4: 22  \n- Node 1 and Node 0: 19  \n- Node 1 and Node 2: 23  \n- Node 1 and Node 3: 16  \n- Node 1 and Node 4: 25  \n- Node 2 and Node 0: 19  \n- Node 2 and Node 1: 16  \n- Node 2 and Node 3: 19  \n- Node 2 and Node 4: 21  \n- Node 3 and Node 0: 25  \n- Node 3 and Node 1: 19  \n- Node 3 and Node 2: 21  \n- Node 3 and Node 4: 17  \n- Node 4 and Node 0: 19  \n- Node 4 and Node 1: 22  \n- Node 4 and Node 2: 19  \n- Node 4 and Node 3: 21  \n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Facility Selection Limit**: Exactly 2 facilities must be selected from the 5 available. This means the sum of the selection decisions for all facilities must equal 2.\n2. **Pairwise Contribution Rules**:\n   - A pair of facilities can only contribute to the dispersion score if both facilities in the pair are selected.\n   - If either facility in a pair is not selected, the pair cannot contribute to the dispersion score.\n   - If both facilities in a pair are selected, the pair must contribute to the dispersion score.\n\n#### Numerical Parameters:\n- The weights for each pair of facilities are explicitly provided in the objective section above.\n- The total number of facilities to select is fixed at 2.\n\n#### Summary:\nYour task is to select 2 facilities out of 5 such that the total dispersion score, calculated as the sum of the weighted distances between all selected pairs, is maximized. The selection must adhere to the constraints that ensure only valid pairs contribute to the dispersion score and that exactly 2 facilities are chosen.", "answer": 49, "ori": "13_optmath_bench", "index": 42}
{"question": "The problem involves scheduling production tasks for five jobs (Job 0 through Job 4) in a manufacturing facility. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, with each operation taking exactly 1 unit of time to complete. The facility has a limited number of machines, and certain operations from different jobs may require the same machine. The goal is to minimize the total production time, known as the makespan, while ensuring that all operational constraints are satisfied.\n\nEach operation within a job must start only after the previous operation in the same job is completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 is finished. Operations that require the same machine cannot overlap in time. To enforce this, binary decision variables are used to determine the order of operations on each machine. For instance, if Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 0 of Job 1 on Machine 1, the binary variable \\( X_{(0,0),(1,0)} \\) is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. A large constant (100000) is used in the constraints to ensure that the sequencing is properly enforced.\n\nThe makespan must be at least as long as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 4 finishes at time 10, the makespan must be at least 10. All operation start times must be non-negative, and the binary decision variables can only take values of 0 or 1.\n\nThe objective is to determine the start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines such that the total production time is minimized. This must be done while ensuring that all precedence constraints, machine capacity constraints, and non-negativity constraints are satisfied.

{"question": "You are tasked with optimizing the placement of facilities across a network of five locations (Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 4) to maximize the overall benefit derived from their interactions. Each location has the potential to host a facility, but due to budget constraints, you can only select **exactly 3 locations** to establish facilities. The goal is to maximize the total benefit generated by the interactions between the selected facilities.\n\n#### Key Details:\n1. **Facility Selection**: You must choose exactly 3 out of the 5 locations to establish facilities. Each location can either be selected (1) or not selected (0).\n2. **Interaction Benefits**: The benefit of interaction between any two facilities depends on the specific pair of locations. For example:\n   - If facilities are placed at Node 0 and Node 1, the interaction benefit is **16**.\n   - If facilities are placed at Node 0 and Node 2, the interaction benefit is **20**.\n   - Similarly, the interaction benefits for all other pairs are provided in the table below.\n\n3. **Interaction Rules**:\n   - An interaction benefit is only counted if **both facilities in the pair are selected**. For example, if Node 0 and Node 1 are both selected, the interaction benefit of 16 is added to the total.\n   - If only one facility in a pair is selected, no interaction benefit is counted for that pair.\n\n4. **Interaction Benefit Table**:\n   | Pair of Nodes | Interaction Benefit |\n   |---------------|---------------------|\n   | Node 0 & Node 1 | 16                  |\n   | Node 0 & Node 2 | 20                  |\n   | Node 0 & Node 3 | 18                  |\n   | Node 0 & Node 4 | 22                  |\n   | Node 1 & Node 0 | 25                  |\n   | Node 1 & Node 2 | 24                  |\n   | Node 1 & Node 3 | 17                  |\n   | Node 1 & Node 4 | 16                  |\n   | Node 2 & Node 0 | 19                  |\n   | Node 2 & Node 1 | 22                  |\n   | Node 2 & Node 3 | 18                  |\n   | Node 2 & Node 4 | 23                  |\n   | Node 3 & Node 0 | 21                  |\n   | Node 3 & Node 1 | 21                  |\n   | Node 3 & Node 2 | 25                  |\n   | Node 3 & Node 4 | 17                  |\n   | Node 4 & Node 0 | 20                  |\n   | Node 4 & Node 1 | 19                  |\n   | Node 4 & Node 2 | 22                  |\n   | Node 4 & Node 3 | 16                  |\n\n5. **Constraints**:\n   - **Facility Selection Constraint**: Exactly 3 facilities must be selected out of the 5 locations.\n   - **Interaction Constraints**: For each pair of locations, the interaction benefit is only counted if both facilities in the pair are selected. This is enforced by ensuring that:\n     - If either facility in a pair is not selected, the interaction benefit for that pair is not counted.\n     - If both facilities in a pair are selected, the interaction benefit is fully counted.\n\n6. **Objective**:\n   - Maximize the total interaction benefit across all selected facility pairs.\n\n#### Example:\nSuppose you select facilities at Node 0, Node 1, and Node 2. The total interaction benefit would be calculated as follows:\n- Node 0 & Node 1: 16\n- Node 0 & Node 2: 20\n- Node 1 & Node 2: 24  \nTotal Benefit = 16 + 20 + 24 = **60**\n\nYour task is to determine the optimal selection of 3 facilities that maximizes the total interaction benefit, considering all the constraints and interaction rules provided.", "answer": 127, "ori": "13_optmath_bench", "index": 46}

{"question": "There are 5 jobs, labeled Job 0 to Job 4, each consisting of 2 operations. Each operation must be performed on a specific machine, and the order of operations within a job is fixed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 must be completed before Operation 2 of Job 0 can begin. The processing time for each operation is 1 unit of time. The facility has a limited number of machines, and some operations from different jobs must be performed on the same machine. To avoid conflicts, no two operations can be scheduled on the same machine at the same time. This requires determining the order in which operations are processed on each machine.

{"question": "Job Shop Scheduling in a Manufacturing Facility\n\nYou are managing a manufacturing facility that produces custom parts for various clients. The facility has multiple machines, each capable of performing specific operations. There are seven jobs (Job 0 to Job 6) that need to be processed, and each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order. Each operation is assigned to a particular machine, and no two operations can be processed on the same machine simultaneously.\n\n#### Objective:\nYour goal is to minimize the **makespan**, which is the total time required to complete all jobs. This ensures that all jobs are finished as quickly as possible, allowing the facility to meet client deadlines and optimize resource utilization.\n\n#### Decisions to Be Made:\n1. **Start Times**: Determine the start time for each operation of every job.\n2. **Operation Order**: Decide the order in which operations are processed on each machine, ensuring no overlaps.\n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Precedence Constraints**:\n   - Each operation in a job must start only after the previous operation in the same job has been completed. For example:\n     - Operation 1 of Job 0 must start at least 1 time unit after Operation 0 of Job 0 has finished.\n     - Operation 1 of Job 1 must start at least 1 time unit after Operation 0 of Job 1 has finished.\n     - This pattern applies to all jobs and their respective operations.\n\n2. **Machine Capacity Constraints**:\n   - No two operations assigned to the same machine can overlap in time. For example:\n     - If Operation 1 of Job 3 and Operation 0 of Job 4 are assigned to the same machine, they must be scheduled such that one starts only after the other has finished. A binary decision variable determines the order of these operations.\n     - Similar constraints apply to all pairs of operations sharing the same machine, such as:\n       - Operation 1 of Job 3 and Operation 1 of Job 4.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 3 and Operation 1 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 4 and Operation 1 of Job 4.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 4 and Operation 1 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 4 and Operation 1 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 2.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 2.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 1.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 2.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 3.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 5.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 2.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 3.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 1 of Job 5.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 1 and Operation 0 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 0 of Job 3.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 1 of Job 5.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 2 and Operation 0 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 3 and Operation 1 of Job 5.\n       - Operation 0 of Job 3 and Operation 0 of Job 6.\n       - Operation 1 of Job 5 and Operation 0 of Job 6.\n\n3. **Makespan Definition**:\n   - The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example:\n     - The makespan must be at least 1 time unit after the completion of Operation 0 of Job 0.\n     - The makespan must be at least 1 time unit after the completion of Operation 1 of Job 0.\n     - This applies to all operations across all jobs.\n\n4. **Non-Negativity**:\n   - All start times must be non-negative, meaning no operation can start before time zero.\n\n5. **Binary Variables**:\n   - Binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. For example:\n     - A binary variable decides whether Operation 1 of Job 3 is processed before or after Operation 0 of Job 4 on the same machine.\n     - Similar binary variables are used for all relevant pairs of operations sharing the same machine.\n\n#### Numerical Parameters:\n- The processing time for each operation is implicitly defined by the constraints, with a minimum required gap of 1 time unit between consecutive operations of the same job.\n- The large constant \\( N = 100,000 \\) is used in the machine capacity constraints to ensure that the binary variables correctly enforce the order of operations.\n\n#### Summary:\nYour task is to schedule the start times of all operations across all jobs and machines in such a way that the total completion time (makespan) is minimized. You must ensure that all precedence and machine capacity constraints are satisfied, and that the makespan reflects the latest completion time of any operation.

{"question": "In a manufacturing facility, six distinct jobs labeled Job 0 to Job 5 need to be processed on a set of machines. Each job consists of two operations that must be performed in a specific order, with each operation assigned to a specific machine. The goal is to schedule these operations to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan, ensuring all jobs are completed as quickly as possible.\n\nEach operation has a processing time of 1 unit. For each job, the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. For example, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 is finished, and this applies to all jobs.\n\nIf two operations are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap in time. The order in which they are processed is determined by a binary decision variable. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 1 of Job 4 are assigned to the same machine, one must be scheduled before the other. The binary variable X_(0,1)_(4,1) determines the order: if X_(0,1)_(4,1) is 1, then Operation 1 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 1 of Job 4; if it is 0, then Operation 1 of Job 4 is scheduled before Operation 1 of Job 0. This logic applies to all pairs of operations on shared machines.\n\nThe total completion time, C_max, must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, C_max must be greater than or equal to the completion time of Operation 0 of Job 0, which is S_(0,0) plus 1 unit.

{"question": "In a manufacturing facility, six jobs labeled Job 0 through Job 5 must be scheduled, each consisting of two operations. The goal is to minimize the total production time (makespan), ensuring all jobs are completed efficiently. Each operation has a processing time of 1 unit of time. Operations within the same job must follow a sequence: the second operation cannot start until the first operation is completed. For example, Operation (0,1) of Job 0 cannot start until Operation (0,0) of Job 0 is finished, and this applies to all jobs.\n\nCertain operations share the same machine and cannot overlap in time. The machine assignments are inferred from the constraints, which specify pairwise relationships between operations. For example, Operation (0,0) of Job 0 and Operation (3,0) of Job 3 must be scheduled on the same machine without overlapping, and similarly for other operation pairs. The order of operations on shared machines is determined by binary decision variables. For instance, if Operation (0,0) of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation (3,0) of Job 3 on a shared machine, the corresponding binary variable is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.\n\nThe total production time (makespan) must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, if Operation (0,0) of Job 0 finishes at time 1 and Operation (0,1) of Job 0 finishes at time 2, the makespan must be at least 2. Similarly, if Operation (5,1) of Job 5 finishes at time 10, the makespan must be at least 10.\n\nTo enforce the constraints, a large constant \\( N = 100,000 \\) is used in the machine capacity constraints to ensure that operations sharing the same machine do not overlap. The start times of all operations are continuous variables, and the binary variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. The objective is to minimize the makespan while respecting the precedence constraints within jobs, the machine capacity constraints, and the non-negativity and binary constraints on the decision variables.", "answer": 4, "ori": "13_optmath_bench", "index": 87}
{"question": "Cell Tower Coverage Planning\n\nYou are tasked with planning the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 32 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be covered by cell tower signals. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total cost of building the towers does not exceed the available budget.\n\n#### Key Details:\n1. **Population Coverage**: Each area has a specific population size that can be covered if a cell tower is built in a location that serves that area. The populations of the areas range from 2,010 to 4,970 people, with the total population across all areas being a critical factor in your decision-making.\n\n2. **Cell Tower Options**: There are 29 potential cell tower locations, each with a unique construction cost. The costs range from 210 units for Tower 1 to 498 units for Tower 6. Building a tower at any of these locations will enable coverage for specific areas, depending on the tower's range and location.\n\n3. **Coverage Requirements**: For an area to be considered covered, at least one of the cell towers that can serve it must be built. For example, Area 0 can be covered if any of Towers 0, 2, 5, 6, 11, 18, 20, 21, 26, or 27 are built. Similar coverage relationships exist for all 32 areas.\n\n4. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected cell towers must not exceed 3,226 units. This budget must be carefully allocated to maximize population coverage while staying within the financial limit.\n\n5. **Decision Variables**:\n   - **Build Decisions**: For each of the 29 cell tower locations, you must decide whether to build the tower (yes or no).\n   - **Coverage Decisions**: For each of the 32 areas, you must determine whether it will be covered (yes or no), based on the towers built.\n\n#### Objective:\nYour primary objective is to maximize the total population covered by the cell towers. This means selecting a combination of towers to build that ensures the largest possible number of people across the 32 areas have access to cell service, while staying within the budget.\n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Coverage Logic**: An area can only be considered covered if at least one of the cell towers capable of serving it is built. For example, Area 1 can only be covered if at least one of Towers 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20, 23, or 28 is built.\n\n2. **Budget Limit**: The total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed 3,226 units. This requires careful selection of towers to balance coverage and cost.\n\n3. **Binary Decisions**: Both the decision to build a tower and the decision to cover an area are binary (yes or no). You cannot partially build a tower or partially cover an area.\n\n#### Numerical Parameters:\n- **Population Sizes**: The populations of the 32 areas are as follows:\n  - Area 0: 2,285\n  - Area 1: 3,023\n  - Area 2: 3,557\n  - Area 3: 3,938\n  - Area 4: 3,689\n  - Area 5: 2,426\n  - Area 6: 4,697\n  - Area 7: 3,214\n  - Area 8: 2,580\n  - Area 9: 2,010\n  - Area 10: 3,180\n  - Area 11: 4,083\n  - Area 12: 2,787\n  - Area 13: 3,095\n  - Area 14: 2,898\n  - Area 15: 4,374\n  - Area 16: 4,970\n  - Area 17: 3,689\n  - Area 18: 4,612\n  - Area 19: 3,232\n  - Area 20: 4,177\n  - Area 21: 2,211\n  - Area 22: 3,123\n  - Area 23: 4,194\n  - Area 24: 3,774\n  - Area 25: 3,391\n  - Area 26: 3,959\n  - Area 27: 3,010\n  - Area 28: 3,213\n  - Area 29: 3,106\n  - Area 30: 2,652\n  - Area 31: 3,441\n\n- **Tower Costs**: The construction costs for the 29 towers are as follows:\n  - Tower 0: 323 units\n  - Tower 1: 210 units\n  - Tower 2: 360 units\n  - Tower 3: 480 units\n  - Tower 4: 375 units\n  - Tower 5: 491 units\n  - Tower 6: 498 units\n  - Tower 7: 267 units\n  - Tower 8: 413 units\n  - Tower 9: 417 units\n  - Tower 10: 291 units\n  - Tower 11: 388 units\n  - Tower 12: 284 units\n  - Tower 13: 463 units\n  - Tower 14: 309 units\n  - Tower 15: 382 units\n  - Tower 16: 476 units\n  - Tower 17: 325 units\n  - Tower 18: 428 units\n  - Tower 19: 265 units\n  - Tower 20: 323 units\n  - Tower 21: 282 units\n  - Tower 22: 441 units\n  - Tower 23: 467 units\n  - Tower 24: 491 units\n  - Tower 25: 232 units\n  - Tower 26: 396 units\n  - Tower 27: 370 units\n  - Tower 28: 309 units\n\n#### Summary:\nYour task is to select which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total population covered is maximized while staying within the budget of 3,226 units.

{"question": "The problem involves assigning employees to shifts across two restaurants to meet specific skill demands while minimizing costs. There are seven employees, each with specific availability and skill capabilities. Each shift at each restaurant requires one employee with Skill 0. Assigning an employee to a shift incurs a cost: some assignments cost 1 unit, while others cost 3 units. If a shift cannot be filled, a penalty of 100 units is incurred per unfulfilled position.\n\nEmployees are only available for certain shifts, as specified by the availability constraints. For example, Employee 0 is available for Shift 0 but not for Shift 1 at Restaurant 1, and Employee 1 is available for Shift 0 but not for Shift 1 at Restaurant 1. Employees can only be assigned to roles that match their skills, and each employee can be assigned to at most one shift across all restaurants and roles. The total number of employees assigned to a shift plus any unfulfilled positions must equal the demand for that shift.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total cost, which includes the cost of assigning employees to roles based on their preferences and the penalty cost for any unfulfilled positions.

{"question": "Cell Tower Coverage Planning\n\nYou are tasked with planning the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 32 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be served. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover, ensuring that the total cost of building the towers does not exceed the available budget.\n\n#### Key Decisions:\n1. **Build or Not Build**: For each of the 30 potential cell tower locations, you must decide whether to build the tower (yes or no). Building a tower incurs a specific cost, which varies by location.\n2. **Coverage Assignment**: For each of the 32 areas, you must determine whether it will be covered by at least one of the built towers (yes or no). An area is considered covered if at least one of the towers that can serve it is built.\n\n#### Objective:\nMaximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the 32 areas are as follows:\n- Area 0: 4,657\n- Area 1: 4,663\n- Area 2: 3,139\n- Area 3: 2,579\n- Area 4: 3,171\n- Area 5: 2,796\n- Area 6: 3,502\n- Area 7: 4,951\n- Area 8: 4,211\n- Area 9: 2,885\n- Area 10: 4,948\n- Area 11: 2,195\n- Area 12: 4,002\n- Area 13: 3,856\n- Area 14: 2,663\n- Area 15: 3,197\n- Area 16: 4,465\n- Area 17: 4,648\n- Area 18: 3,796\n- Area 19: 4,714\n- Area 20: 4,952\n- Area 21: 3,088\n- Area 22: 4,029\n- Area 23: 3,379\n- Area 24: 2,002\n- Area 25: 3,840\n- Area 26: 4,037\n- Area 27: 4,246\n- Area 28: 4,852\n- Area 29: 4,423\n- Area 30: 2,630\n- Area 31: 4,951\n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Coverage Requirements**: Each area must be covered by at least one of the built towers. The specific towers that can cover each area are listed below:\n   - Area 0 can be covered by Towers 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, or 28.\n   - Area 1 can be covered by Towers 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 25, or 27.\n   - (Similar detailed coverage relationships apply for all 32 areas, as specified in the LP data.)\n\n2. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected towers must not exceed the available budget of 3,204 units.

{"question": "In a manufacturing facility, you are tasked with scheduling a set of jobs across multiple machines to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan. Each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be performed in a specific order, and each operation is assigned to a particular machine. The goal is to determine the start times for each operation on its assigned machine while respecting the following constraints:\n\nEach job has a predefined sequence of operations. For example, Job 0 has two operations: Operation 0 must be completed before Operation 1 can begin. Similarly, Job 1 has Operation 0 and Operation 1, with Operation 0 preceding Operation 1. This pattern applies to all jobs, ensuring that no operation starts before its predecessor in the same job has finished. Specifically, for Job 0, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed, and for Job 1, Operation 1 cannot start until Operation 0 has been completed. This logic applies to all jobs, ensuring the correct sequence of operations.\n\nEach machine can process only one operation at a time. To prevent overlapping, the start times of operations assigned to the same machine must be carefully scheduled. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1 are assigned to the same machine, they cannot overlap. A binary decision variable determines the order in which these operations are processed. If Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled first, Operation 0 of Job 1 must start only after Operation 0 of Job 0 has finished, and vice versa. Similar constraints apply to all pairs of operations assigned to the same machine, ensuring no two operations overlap. A large constant (100,000) is used in the constraints to enforce the order of operations on shared machines.\n\nThe makespan is defined as the total time required to complete all jobs. It must be at least as large as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 6 finishes at time 100, the makespan must be at least 100. This ensures that the makespan accurately reflects the total time needed to complete all operations.\n\nThe start time of every operation must be non-negative, meaning no operation can start before time zero. Binary variables are used to determine the order of operations on shared machines. These variables can only take values of 0 or 1, representing the scheduling decisions. The processing time for each operation is implicitly defined by the constraints. For example, the precedence constraints specify that Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has been completed, with a required gap of at least 1 time unit. The binary variables determine the order of operations on shared machines. For instance, if the binary variable for Operation 0 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 1 is 1, Operation 0 of Job 0 is scheduled before Operation 0 of Job 1 on the same machine. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. For example, if Operation 0 of Job 0 finishes at time 10, the makespan must be at least 10.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring that all jobs are completed in the shortest possible time while respecting the precedence and machine capacity constraints. This problem requires determining the optimal start times for all operations and the sequence of operations on shared machines to achieve the minimum total completion time.", "answer": 3, "ori": "13_optmath_bench", "index": 104}
{"question": "There are 7 jobs, labeled Job 0 through Job 6, each consisting of 2 operations that must be performed in sequence. Each operation takes 1 unit of time to complete. The facility has a limited number of machines, and some operations from different jobs must be performed on the same machine. To avoid conflicts, no two operations can be scheduled on the same machine at the same time. A binary decision variable determines the order in which these operations are scheduled. For example, if Operation 1 of Job 0 and Operation 0 of Job 3 are assigned to the same machine, the binary variable ensures that one operation starts at least 1 unit of time after the other. Within each job, operations must be performed in the specified order. For instance, Operation 1 of Job 0 cannot start until Operation 0 of Job 0 has been completed. The makespan, defined as the total time required to complete all jobs, must be at least as large as the completion time of the last operation across all jobs. For every pair of operations that share the same machine, a binary variable determines the order in which they are scheduled. The objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring that all jobs are completed in the shortest possible time. The start time of the second operation in each job must be at least 1 unit of time after the start time of the first operation. For every pair of operations assigned to the same machine, the schedule must ensure that they do not overlap. The makespan must be at least as large as the completion time of every operation. All start times must be non-negative. The binary variables that determine the order of operations on the same machine must be either 0 or 1. A large constant, 100,000, is used in the constraints to enforce the order of operations on shared machines. The processing time for every operation is 1 unit of time.

{"question": "Imagine you are managing a power generation system responsible for supplying electricity to a region over five distinct periods. The system consists of three types of power generators, each with unique operational characteristics and costs. Your goal is to determine the optimal number of generators to operate, the amount of power each generator should produce, and when to start up additional generators to meet the region's electricity demand at the lowest possible cost.\n\n#### Key Decisions:\n1. **Number of Generators to Operate**: For each generator type (Type 0, Type 1, Type 2) and each period (Period 0 to Period 4), decide how many generators should be active.\n2. **Power Output**: Determine the amount of power (in MW) each active generator should produce during each period.\n3. **Generator Startups**: Decide whether to start up additional generators in each period, incurring a startup cost.\n\n#### Objective:\nMinimize the total cost of operating the power generation system, which includes:\n- **Base Costs**: Each active generator incurs a fixed cost of 79 units per period, regardless of its power output.\n- **Per-MW Costs**: Each generator also incurs a variable cost based on its power output: 3 units per MW for Type 0, 4 units per MW for Type 1, and 4 units per MW for Type 2.\n- **Startup Costs**: Starting up a generator incurs a one-time cost of 355 units for Type 0 and 349 units for Types 1 and 2.\n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Demand Satisfaction**: The total power output across all generators must meet or exceed the region's electricity demand in each period. The demands are:\n   - Period 0: 167 MW\n   - Period 1: 212 MW\n   - Period 2: 224 MW\n   - Period 3: 221 MW\n   - Period 4: 189 MW\n\n2. **Generator Capacity Limits**:\n   - Each generator has a minimum and maximum power output:\n     - Type 0: Minimum 35 MW, Maximum 128 MW\n     - Type 1: Minimum 35 MW, Maximum 129 MW\n     - Type 2: Minimum 35 MW, Maximum 125 MW\n   - The power output of each generator must be within these limits based on whether it is active.\n\n3. **Reserve Margin**: To ensure reliability, the total maximum possible power output across all generators must be at least 15% higher than the demand in each period.

{"question": "The problem involves scheduling operations for five jobs (Job 0 through Job 4) in a manufacturing facility, where each job consists of two operations that must be performed in sequence. Each operation takes exactly 1 unit of time to complete. The facility has a limited number of machines, and multiple operations from different jobs may need to be assigned to the same machine. A machine can only handle one operation at a time, so the order of operations on shared machines must be determined to avoid overlaps. \n\nThe goal is to minimize the total completion time, known as the makespan, which is the time at which the last operation across all jobs finishes. To achieve this, the start times of all operations must be scheduled such that: (1) for each job, the second operation starts only after the first operation is completed; (2) if two operations are assigned to the same machine, one must finish before the other starts; and (3) the makespan is at least as large as the completion time of every operation. \n\nThe order of operations on shared machines is determined using binary decision variables, which indicate whether one operation is scheduled before another. A large constant (100000) is used in the constraints to enforce the sequencing of operations on shared machines. The start times of operations and the makespan are continuous variables, while the binary variables are restricted to values of 0 or 1. The objective is to minimize the makespan, ensuring all jobs are completed as quickly as possible.", "answer": 4, "ori": "13_optmath_bench", "index": 121}

Each location has unique characteristics, and the goal is to select exactly three locations to establish these centers. The effectiveness of the system is measured by the combined coverage scores between the selected centers, which are determined by predefined pairwise scores representing the strategic importance of connecting each pair of locations.\n\n#### Key Decisions:\n1. **Selecting Locations**: You must choose exactly three out of the five locations to establish emergency response centers. Each location is represented by a binary decision: if a center is established at a location, it is selected (1); otherwise, it is not (0).\n2. **Pairwise Coverage**: For each pair of selected locations, the coverage score is determined by the predefined pairwise importance values. These scores reflect the strategic benefit of having both locations in the network.\n\n#### Objective:\nMaximize the total coverage score across all pairs of selected locations.

To prevent subtours, each city is assigned a position number: City 0 is fixed at position 0, and the position numbers for the other cities must be between 1 and 5. If a route is taken from City i to City j, the position number of City j must be greater than the position number of City i. The decision to travel from one city to another is represented by binary variables, where 1 indicates the route is taken and 0 indicates it is not. The objective is to determine the optimal sequence of cities to visit, ensuring each city is visited exactly once, the route forms a complete loop without subtours, and the total distance traveled is minimized.", "answer": 1679, "ori": "13_optmath_bench", "index": 130}
{"question": "Cell Tower Deployment for Regional Coverage\n\nYou are tasked with optimizing the deployment of cell towers across a region to maximize population coverage while adhering to a strict budget constraint. The region is divided into 33 distinct areas, each with a specific population size that needs to be served. Your goal is to determine which cell towers to build and which areas to cover to ensure the maximum number of people have access to cellular service.\n\n#### Key Decisions:\n1. **Which cell towers to build**: There are 29 potential cell tower locations, each with a unique construction cost. You must decide whether to build each tower (a binary decision: build or not build).\n2. **Which areas to cover**: Each of the 33 areas can be either covered or not covered by the deployed cell towers. Coverage for an area is only possible if at least one of the cell towers that can serve it is built.\n\n#### Objective:\nMaximize the total population covered by the deployed cell towers. The population sizes for the 33 areas are as follows:\n- Area 0: 3,522 people  \n- Area 1: 2,492 people  \n- Area 2: 2,865 people  \n- Area 3: 2,596 people  \n- Area 4: 2,194 people  \n- Area 5: 4,001 people  \n- Area 6: 3,027 people  \n- Area 7: 2,581 people  \n- Area 8: 4,848 people  \n- Area 9: 2,814 people  \n- Area 10: 3,543 people  \n- Area 11: 2,234 people  \n- Area 12: 2,960 people  \n- Area 13: 4,297 people  \n- Area 14: 2,792 people  \n- Area 15: 4,520 people  \n- Area 16: 2,685 people  \n- Area 17: 2,022 people  \n- Area 18: 4,858 people  \n- Area 19: 4,814 people  \n- Area 20: 3,432 people  \n- Area 21: 3,730 people  \n- Area 22: 2,526 people  \n- Area 23: 3,277 people  \n- Area 24: 4,363 people  \n- Area 25: 2,622 people  \n- Area 26: 3,740 people  \n- Area 27: 4,594 people  \n- Area 28: 3,193 people  \n- Area 29: 4,275 people  \n- Area 30: 4,407 people  \n- Area 31: 3,809 people  \n- Area 32: 2,163 people  \n\n#### Constraints:\n1. **Coverage Requirements**: For an area to be considered covered, at least one of the cell towers that can serve it must be built. The specific combinations of cell towers that can cover each area are provided in the data. For example:\n   - Area 0 can be covered if any of the following towers are built: Tower 3, Tower 5, Tower 7, Tower 10, Tower 11, Tower 13, Tower 15, Tower 17, Tower 19, Tower 22, Tower 23, Tower 26, Tower 27, or Tower 28.\n   - Similar constraints apply to all 33 areas, with each area having a unique set of towers that can provide coverage.\n\n2. **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of building the selected cell towers must not exceed the available budget of 3,059 units. The construction costs for the 29 towers are as follows:\n   - Tower 0: 303 units  \n   - Tower 1: 378 units  \n   - Tower 2: 327 units  \n   - Tower 3: 444 units  \n   - Tower 4: 391 units  \n   - Tower 5: 357 units  \n   - Tower 6: 444 units  \n   - Tower 7: 244 units  \n   - Tower 8: 433 units  \n   - Tower 9: 407 units  \n   - Tower 10: 305 units  \n   - Tower 11: 296 units  \n   - Tower 12: 315 units  \n   - Tower 13: 302 units  \n   - Tower 14: 495 units  \n   - Tower 15: 240 units  \n   - Tower 16: 379 units  \n   - Tower 17: 211 units  \n   - Tower 18: 388 units  \n   - Tower 19: 220 units  \n   - Tower 20: 408 units  \n   - Tower 21: 430 units  \n   - Tower 22: 327 units  \n   - Tower 23: 470 units  \n   - Tower 24: 381 units  \n   - Tower 25: 476 units  \n   - Tower 26: 215 units  \n   - Tower 27: 239 units  \n   - Tower 28: 372 units  \n\n3. **Binary Decisions**: Each cell tower can either be built (1) or not built (0), and each area can either be covered (1) or not covered (0).\n\n#### Summary:\nYour task is to select a combination of cell towers to build, ensuring that the total cost does not exceed 3,059 units, while maximizing the total population covered across the 33 areas. The coverage for each area depends on the specific towers built, and the population sizes and tower costs are provided in detail. The goal is to make strategic decisions about tower deployment to achieve the highest possible population coverage within the budget.", "answer": 111796, "ori": "13_optmath_bench", "index": 131}
{"question": "Imagine you are managing the placement of emergency response centers across five key locations in a region. Each location has the potential to host a center, but due to budget constraints, you can only establish **three centers** in total. The goal is to maximize the overall effectiveness of these centers by ensuring they are strategically placed to cover as much critical area as possible.\n\nEach pair of locations has a predefined **effectiveness score** that represents how well a center at one location can support or complement a center at another location. These scores are as follows:\n\n- **Location 0 and Location 1**: 18  \n- **Location 0 and Location 2**: 20  \n- **Location 0 and Location 3**: 22  \n- **Location 0 and Location 4**: 19  \n- **Location 1 and Location 0**: 20  \n- **Location 1 and Location 2**: 15  \n- **Location 1 and Location 3**: 22  \n- **Location 1 and Location 4**: 16  \n- **Location 2 and Location 0**: 23  \n- **Location 2 and Location 1**: 23  \n- **Location 2 and Location 3**: 17  \n- **Location 2 and Location 4**: 22  \n- **Location 3 and Location 0**: 20  \n- **Location 3 and Location 1**: 19  \n- **Location 3 and Location 2**: 23  \n- **Location 3 and Location 4**: 20  \n- **Location 4 and Location 0**: 24  \n- **Location 4 and Location 1**: 16  \n- **Location 4 and Location 2**: 24  \n- **Location 4 and Location 3**: 24  \n\nYour task is to select **three locations** out of the five to establish the centers. The effectiveness of the selected centers is determined by the sum of the pairwise effectiveness scores between the chosen locations. For example, if you select Locations 0, 1, and 2, the total effectiveness would be the sum of the scores for pairs (0,1), (0,2), and (1,2).\n\nHowever, there are specific rules governing the selection:  \n1. A pair of locations can only contribute to the total effectiveness if **both locations in the pair are selected** as centers.  \n2. If only one location in a pair is selected, that pair does not contribute to the effectiveness score.  \n3. The total number of centers must be exactly three.  \n\nYour objective is to determine which three locations to select to **maximize the total effectiveness** of the emergency response centers, ensuring all constraints are met.", "answer": 132, "ori": "13_optmath_bench", "index": 132}
